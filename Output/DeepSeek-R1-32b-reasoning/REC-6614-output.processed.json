      "Precious Myles Garrett, a right-hand dominant children's social worker, presents for evaluation of left wrist pain. The pain is more bothersome than the masses and wakes her at night. She desires to know what can be done about it. She has diagnoses of a left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte, and bilateral thumb and MCP joint issues. The masses used to fluctuate in size but are now constant. She saw a rheumatologist who performed x-rays and an ultrasound of the front of the wrist."
