Okay, so I need to help transform this medical transcript into a structured patient visit note using the provided SOAP template. Let me start by carefully reading through the instructions and the template to understand what each section requires.

First, looking at the JSON template provided, it has several sections: Patient Name, Chief Complaint, HPI Spencer, Musculoskeletal, Imaging Results, Assessment, and Plan. Each has specific instructions on how to extract information from the transcript.

The transcript is a conversation between the doctor and possibly another staff member or patient. The key points I need to extract are:

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's name explicitly. It refers to "she" but doesn't provide a name. So, according to the instructions, I should return "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: This should be a concise statement of why the patient is visiting. From the transcript, the chief complaints are bilateral hand numbness, tingling, and burning pain.

3. **HPI Spencer**: This needs a detailed history of the present illness. The transcript mentions that the symptoms started around July 1, 2025, similar to her previous pregnancy but earlier and more intense. She's been seeing her OB and was recommended injections and referred here. She's been wearing splints without enough improvement.

4. **Musculoskeletal**: Extract physical exam findings related to musculoskeletal. The transcript notes bilateral upper extremity skin is clean, dry, intact without erythema or ecchymosis. Decreased sensation to the middle fingers is noted.

5. **Imaging Results**: The doctor deferred X-rays due to pregnancy, planning for carpal tunnel later. No imaging results are mentioned, so default to "-".

6. **Assessment**: Active problems include bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and decreased sensation in the middle fingers.

7. **Plan**: The plan is to proceed with injections today, discuss risks, and follow up in three months postpartum.

I need to make sure each section follows the template's instructions precisely, using the exact wording from the transcript where necessary. Also, ensure that any missing information uses the default values specified.
