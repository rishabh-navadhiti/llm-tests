Alright, I need to process the given medical transcript and fill out the JSON template according to the instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking for the patient's name. Scanning through the conversation, I don't see any explicit mention of a name. The doctor refers to "he" and "his," but no full name is provided. So, I'll put "-" as instructed.

Next, the Chief Complaint. The transcript mentions that the patient presents for evaluation of index finger pain and stiffness after a laceration. So, the chief complaint is about the stiff finger.

For the HPI Spencer section, I need to summarize the history of present illness. The patient injured his finger on 7-16-25 while working with a chisel. He went to urgent care where it was irrigated and repaired. The sutures were removed after 14 days, but the wound opened up. Now he has stiffness and limited movement.

Moving on to Musculoskeletal findings. The doctor's examination notes include a stiff index finger PIP joint, limited flexion to 10 degrees, moderate swelling, and no sensory tenderness. That's what I'll extract verbatim.

Imaging Results: The doctor mentions that X-rays were taken and are normal. So, I'll note that as "X-ray normal."

In the Assessment section, the active problems are the index finger PIP laceration and the stiff finger. These are direct from the conversation without any additional details.

Lastly, the Plan. The doctor recommends hand therapy and a follow-up in four weeks. There's no mention of X-rays being deferred, so I'll exclude that part.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly, using "-" where information isn't present. Also, maintaining the exact structure and order as provided.
