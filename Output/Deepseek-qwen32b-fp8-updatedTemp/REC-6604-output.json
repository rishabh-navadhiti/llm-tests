Okay, so I need to process this medical transcript and create a structured patient visit note using the provided JSON template. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, the Patient Name. The transcript mentions Nicole Coffee, so that's straightforward. I'll extract her full name exactly as it appears.

Next is the Chief Complaint. The doctor says she's here for pain in the left index finger. That's clear, so I'll note that without any extra details.

Moving on to the History of Present Illness (HPI Spencer). The transcript mentions that Nicole has had pain for a few months, noticed it when she came in for a shoulder appointment, and it's gotten worse. She wants an injection now. I'll summarize this into a coherent paragraph, focusing on onset, duration, and progression without adding any interpretations.

For the Musculoskeletal examination, the doctor notes tenderness on the left index finger with an A1 pulley, triggering, and good range of motion. I'll extract this verbatim as per the instructions.

Imaging Results are mentioned as X-rays of the finger being normal. I'll include that exactly as stated.

The Assessment should list active problems. From the transcript, the main issues are pain in the left index finger, triggering, and tenderness. I'll present these as a concise list.

Finally, the Plan. The doctor decides to do a trigger finger injection today, and the X-rays are normal. I'll include these as the plan, making sure to follow the exact wording from the transcript.

I need to ensure that each section follows the template strictly, using the correct keys and defaults where necessary. Also, I must avoid any grammatical errors and maintain a professional tone throughout.
