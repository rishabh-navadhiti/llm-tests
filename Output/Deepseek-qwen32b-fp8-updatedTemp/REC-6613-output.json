Okay, so I need to help transform the given medical transcript into a structured patient visit note using the provided JSON template. Let me start by understanding the template and the instructions carefully.

First, the template has several sections: Patient Name, Chief Complaint, HPI Spencer, Musculoskeletal, Imaging Results, Assessment, and Plan. Each section has specific instructions on what to extract and how to format it.

Looking at the transcript, the doctor mentions "Precious Myles Garrett" as the patient. So, the Patient Name should be "Precious Myles Garrett".

The Chief Complaint is about left wrist pain and masses. The doctor says she presents for evaluation of her left wrist pain, so that's the chief complaint.

For the HPI Spencer section, I need to summarize the History of Present Illness. The patient is a right-hand dominant social worker with left wrist pain that's bothersome enough to wake her at night. She also has masses on her wrist and thumb MCP joint. The pain has been constant, and she's been treated by Dr. Ishimori. The HPI should include onset, duration, location, severity, and treatments. I'll structure this into a coherent paragraph.

Next is Musculoskeletal. The physical exam findings are: a pea-sized mass on the first dorsal compartment, non-tender, mobile. Another mass on the thumb MCP, non-mobile, minimally tender. Range of motion is excellent. I'll extract these verbatim as per the instruction.

Imaging Results: The transcript mentions X-rays showing an osteophyte and an ultrasound showing a retinacular cyst and avulsion fragment. I'll list these exactly as dictated.

Assessment should be a list of active problems. From the transcript, the issues are left wrist pain, left first dorsal compartment cyst, and left thumb MCP joint osteophyte. These are the main conditions.

Plan includes night splints, observation of masses, and follow-up in six weeks. The doctor also mentions considering aspiration or biopsy, but since the patient didn't agree, it's noted as a consideration.

I need to ensure each section follows the template's instructions, using correct medical terms and avoiding any inferences. Also, the JSON must be properly formatted without any extra text.
