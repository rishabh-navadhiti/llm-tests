Okay, so I need to help the user by creating a structured patient visit note using the SOAP template provided. The user has given me a JSON template and a medical transcript to process. My task is to extract the necessary information from the transcript and fill it into the JSON structure accurately.

First, I'll start by looking at the transcript to identify the patient's name. The doctor mentions "Precious Myles Garrett" clearly, so that's the patient's full name. I'll make sure to extract that exactly as it appears.

Next, the chief complaint. The patient is presenting for evaluation of her left wrist pain, as stated in the conversation. I'll note that as the chief complaint without any extra details.

Moving on to the History of Present Illness (HPI). The patient is a right-hand dominant social worker with left wrist pain that's more bothersome than the masses. The pain wakes her at night, and she wants to know her treatment options. She's been treated by Dr. Ishimori and has diagnoses including a left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte, and bilateral thumb and MCP joint issues. The masses used to fluctuate in size but are now constant. She saw her rheumatologist, who did X-rays and an ultrasound. I'll summarize this into a coherent paragraph, focusing on onset, duration, location, severity, and treatments.

For the musculoskeletal examination, the doctor's notes mention the left upper extremity skin is clean without any issues. There's a pea-sized mass over the first dorsal compartment, mobile and non-tender. Negative Finklestein test, no pain with thumb extension. Another mass at the dorsal ulnar aspect of the thumb MCP joint, non-mobile, minimally tender, with good range of motion. No tenderness at the A1 point, no locking or catching. I'll extract these findings verbatim as per the template's instructions.

Imaging results include outside X-rays showing an osteophyte at the thumb MCP joint and an ultrasound showing a bony avulsion fragment versus osteophyte at the MCP joint and a retinacular cyst in the wrist. I'll list these exactly as dictated.

The assessment should include active problems: left wrist pain, left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP joint osteophyte, and bilateral thumb and MCP joint masses. I'll list these as concise points.

The plan includes recommending night splints for carpal tunnel, observing the masses since they aren't bothering her, and scheduling a follow-up in six weeks. I'll note the aspiration versus biopsy consideration as part of the plan.

I need to ensure all sections are filled correctly, using the default "-" where information isn't present. I'll double-check for any grammatical errors and maintain a professional tone throughout. Finally, I'll structure the JSON exactly as the template specifies, ensuring it's valid and can be parsed without issues.
