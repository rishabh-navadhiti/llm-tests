Alright, I need to process the given medical transcript and transform it into the structured patient visit note using the provided JSON template. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, I'll look for the patient's name. The transcript doesn't mention a specific name, so I'll use the default "-".

Next, the chief complaint. The doctor mentions "bilateral hand numbness and tingling as well as burning pain." That's the main issue, so I'll note that.

For the History of Present Illness (HPI), the patient reports symptoms starting around July 1, 2025. She had similar issues at the end of her previous pregnancy, but now they're more severe. She's been wearing splints without enough improvement, so she's here for evaluation.

Moving on to the musculoskeletal exam findings. The doctor notes bilateral upper extremity skin is clean, dry, intact without erythema or ecchymosis. There's decreased sensation to the middle fingers. So I'll list these as verbatim.

Imaging results: X-rays were deferred due to pregnancy, so I'll note that as per the transcript.

Assessment should include both symptoms and diagnoses. She has bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, hand numbness, tingling, burning pain, and decreased sensation. These are the active issues.

The plan includes recommending injections after discussing risks, performing them today, and scheduling a follow-up in three months postpartum. I'll list these points as per the doctor's instructions.

I need to ensure each section follows the template's instructions, using the exact wording where possible and applying defaults when information isn't present. I'll double-check for any grammatical errors and ensure clarity and professionalism throughout.
