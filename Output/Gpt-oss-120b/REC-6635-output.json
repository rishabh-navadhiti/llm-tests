On July 16, 2025 he lacerated the PIP joint of his left index finger while using a chisel; the blade slipped on a hard piece of wood and cut the finger. He presented to urgent care where the wound was irrigated and sutured. Sutures were removed approximately 14 days later, at which time the wound dehisced. Since then he has experienced persistent pain and marked stiffness of the index finger, now limited to about 10 degrees of active flexion."
