Regarding the DIP arthritis, we discussed that there's nothing she can do to prevent worsening of the arthritis in terms of X-ray findings, but there are things that we can do to make it hurt less. That's why she's wearing the splints. She doesn't necessarily need them; they are just for pain. Recommend activity is hard. Consider DIP fusion whenever she would like.
