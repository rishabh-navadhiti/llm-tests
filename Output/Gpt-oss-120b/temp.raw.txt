Need to extract:\n\nPatient name: not mentioned. So default \"-\".\n\nChief Complaint: need only the patient's chief complaint without additional details. From transcript: patient states increasing numbness and tingling of her right hand, burned right thumb, difficulty feeling, etc. Chief complaint likely \"numbness and tingling of right hand\". Must be just the complaint. Use exact phrase? Instruction: Provide only patient's chief complaint without additional details or context. So maybe \"numbness and tingling of right hand\". We'll output that.\n\nHPI: Summarize as paragraph. Need include onset, duration, location, severity, mechanism, treatments, progression. Transcript: She was diagnosed with lymphoma, completed chemo, has been at home more, noticed increasing numbness and tingling of her right hand. Also burned her right thumb, making it more difficult to feel things and put earrings on. Trying to hold phone less. Here for evaluation and treatment. No specific timeline but \"increasing\". We can write: The patient reports progressive numbness and tingling in her right hand that has worsened since completing chemotherapy for lymphoma. She also reports a recent burn to her right thumb, resulting in decreased sensation and difficulty performing fine motor tasks such as putting on earrings and holding a phone. She is seeking evaluation and treatment. That's okay.\n\nMusculoskeletal verbatim: need physical exam findings related to Musculoskeletal. The transcript includes: \"On exam, uh, bilateral upper extremty skin is clean, dry and intact without erythema or ecchymosis. Moderate tenderness of the right small finger. A one foley. There is triggering there. There is a nodule there. Um, excellent range of motion overall. Uh,.pcgs are normal.\" Need verbatim extraction exactly as dictated, no modifications. So we should output that exact string? Provide the musculoskeletal exam findings verbatim. The instruction: \"What is the physical examination finding of this patient related to Musculoskeletal. If not information is found, please return empty. Must be extract what doctor has dictated, Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.\" So we should include exactly the portion related to musculoskeletal. Could include whole sentence. Let's capture: \"bilateral upper extremty skin is clean, dry and intact without erythema or ecchymosis. Moderate tenderness of the right small finger. A one foley. There is triggering there. There is a nodule there. Um, excellent range of motion overall. pcgs are normal.\" Ensure spelling as in transcript. Provide as single string or array? The template expects content array. We'll put the verbatim string as one element in array.\n\nImaging Results: transcript says \"X-ray is clear.\" Also earlier \"Let me see if we did have this one. X-ray is clear.\" So imaging result: \"X-ray is clear.\" Return that.\n\nAssessment: list active problems. From transcript: numbness and tingling of right hand, burned right thumb (maybe \"right thumb sensory loss\"), trigger finger right small finger, carpal tunnel? The doctor mentions plan for carpal tunnel, low threshold for nerve studies. Assessment likely includes \"right hand numbness/tingling\", \"right thumb sensory deficit\", \"trigger finger right small finger\". Also maybe \"carpal tunnel syndrome\". We should list as concise terms. Use dash list. Provide each on separate line. Keep short.\n\nPlan: Write exactly as dictated. The transcript includes: \"Plan B regarding the trigger. Her last injection in her right small finger was in 2015. She would like another today. I think this is reasonable. And then, um, plan carpal tunnel recommend night splints, low threshold for nerve studies. Return to clinic in two months for follow-up.\"\n\nNeed to write as scribe-style summary, using exact treatments, etc. Probably combine sentences. Keep as verbatim? Instruction: Write the doctor's plan exactly as dictated, formatted as a scribe-style summary. So we can paraphrase but must include same content. Use same wording? We'll keep similar wording: \"Plan B regarding the trigger. Her last injection in her right small finger was in 2015; she would like another today, which is reasonable. Plan for carpal tunnel: recommend night splints, low threshold for nerve studies. Return to clinic in two months for follow-up.\"\n\nBut ensure we don't add extra. That's okay.\n\nNow fill JSON array with each object content as list.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nFor each object, \"content\": [] need array of strings. For those with default, if no data then leave empty array? The template default value indicates fallback if empty. We should put content array with extracted string(s). If none, leave empty array.\n\nPatient Name: content [] with \"-\"? Actually default is \"-\". If not found, we should set content to []? The template expects content array; but default value used when content empty. So we can leave content empty. That's fine.\n\nChief Complaint: content with string.\n\nHPI: content with paragraph string.\n\nMusculoskeletal: content with verbatim string.\n\nImaging: content with string.\n\nAssessment: content list each item as separate string.\n\nPlan: content with paragraph string.\n\nLet's produce
