      "Miss Stephanie Humphrey, a right hand dominant horticulturalist, is status post trip and fall on 6/21/25. She presents with left wrist pain that began after the fall, which was painful initially and slightly improved. She sought urgent care, where X-rays showed no fractures and she was diagnosed with a sprain. She subsequently traveled to Massachusetts, where increased humidity exacerbated her pain, prompting her to seek further evaluation and treatment. On exam, left upper extremity skin is clean and intact without erythema or hematomesis. No specific tendon inflammation. Mild tendon inflammation over the ECU tendon. Pain with pronation and supination. No evidence of ECU tendon subluxation. Excellent range of motion overall. X-rays are normal. Plan includes left ECU tendonitis and left ulnar-sided wrist pain. Trial of hand therapy recommended. MRI recommended for further evaluation. Return to clinic after MRI.",

      "Amit Jaini, a left-hand dominant music manager, presents for evaluation of his right small finger pain, swelling, and deformity that began on 8/2/25 after a basketball injury. He had immediate pain, swelling, and limited motion. He was referred by Dr. Andrew Weiss and saw him, who ordered X-rays showing a fracture. The finger was rotated, prompting referral to this office. On exam, right upper extremity skin shows moderate ecchymosis to the small finger. There is obvious malrotation and shortening of the proximal phalanx of the small finger. Limited flexion and extension. Able to initiate a thumbs up. X-rays confirm a shortened, rotated fracture of the proximal phalanx of the small finger. Plan includes closed reduction percutaneous pinning, to be performed tomorrow.",
      "David Schechter, a right hand dominant pain medicine physician, presents with right wrist pain that began around early 2024 without any history of trauma, injury, or injection. The pain is intermittent and has not worsened recently, but is consistently painful in certain positions, particularly with supination and flexion. On exam, right upper extremity skin is clean, dry, and intact without erythema or hematomesis. Mild tendinopathy at the ECU tendon. No evidence of ECU subluxation. X-rays are normal. Four views of the hand with Rolando show mild joint space narrowing at the thumb MCP joint. Plan will be determined based on Dr. De La George's notes."
