      "Spencer is a left-hand dominant artist who works with miniatures for stop-motion films. He presents with persistent index finger pain and stiffness that began on July 16, 2025, after he lacerated his left index finger while using a chisel. He reports that the chisel slipped while he was working on a hard piece of wood, resulting in a dorsal laceration. He sought care at urgent care, where the wound was irrigated and repaired with sutures. Sutures were removed approximately 14 days after the injury, but the wound dehisced at that time. Since then, he has experienced ongoing stiffness and pain in the index finger PIP joint. He has not had any significant improvement in range of motion, which remains limited to about 10 degrees of active flexion. There is no reported history of infection, numbness, or tingling. The symptoms have persisted without resolution, prompting this evaluation."
