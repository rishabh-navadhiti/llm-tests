Okay, so I need to help transform the given medical transcript into a structured patient visit note using the provided JSON template. Let me start by understanding the task step by step.

First, I'll look at the JSON template provided. It has several sections, each with a title, key, content, default, and instruction. My job is to fill in the content for each section based on the medical transcript, making sure to follow the instructions precisely.

Looking at the medical transcript, it's a conversation between a doctor and a patient. The doctor mentions that the patient has bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, presenting with numbness, tingling, and burning pain in both hands. The symptoms started around July 1, 2025, and are more intense than her previous pregnancy symptoms. She's been seeing her OB, who recommended injections and referred her here. The physical exam shows intact skin, decreased sensation in the middle fingers, and she's been wearing splints without much improvement. The doctor recommends injections and a follow-up in three months.

Now, I'll go through each section of the JSON template and extract the necessary information.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's name, so I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient's main issue is bilateral hand numbness, tingling, and burning pain. So, the chief complaint is "Bilateral hand numbness, tingling, and burning pain."

3. **HPI Spencer**: This section requires onset, duration, location, and severity. The onset was around July 1, 2025, duration is ongoing, location is bilateral hands, and severity is more intense than previous symptoms. So, "Onset: July 1, 2025; Duration: Ongoing; Location: Bilateral hands; Severity: More intense than previous symptoms."

4. **Musculoskeletal**: The physical exam findings are bilateral upper extremity skin intact, decreased sensation in the middle fingers. So, "Bilateral upper extremity skin is clean, dry, and intact without erythema or ecchymosis. Decreased sensation to the middle fingers noted."

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript mentions X-rays were deferred due to pregnancy. So, "X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy."

6. **Assessment**: The current medical condition is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. So, "Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome."

7. **Plan**: The plan includes injections, discussing risks, and follow-up. So, the list would be:
   - Trial of injections.
   - Discussed risks and temporary nature.
   - Return to clinic in three months for follow-up if symptoms persist postpartum.

I need to make sure each section is filled correctly, using the exact wording from the transcript where possible, and following the instructions for each section. Also, I should avoid any grammatical errors and ensure proper punctuation.

Let me double-check each section to ensure accuracy and completeness. For example, in the HPI Spencer section, I included all four required aspects. In the Plan, I listed each action as a separate point, using numbers where necessary.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure the order and format match the template exactly.
