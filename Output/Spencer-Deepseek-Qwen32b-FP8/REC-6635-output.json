Alright, I need to process the given medical transcript and convert it into a structured patient visit note using the provided JSON template. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, the patient's name isn't explicitly mentioned in the transcript. The doctor refers to the patient as "he," but there's no name provided. So, I'll use the default value of "-".

Next, the chief complaint. The patient mentions pain and stiffness in the index finger after a laceration. So, the chief complaint should be "Index finger pain and stiffness following laceration."

For the HPI Spencer section, I need to extract the onset, duration, location, and severity. The injury occurred on 7-16-25, so the onset is that date. The duration isn't explicitly stated, but since the patient is seeking evaluation now, I'll note it as "Ongoing." The location is the left index finger PIP joint. The severity includes pain and stiffness, with limited flexion to 10 degrees.

Moving on to Musculoskeletal findings. The doctor's examination notes a well-healing laceration without sutures, a stiff PIP joint with limited flexion, moderate swelling, and no sensory tenderness. I'll list these verbatim as per the instruction.

Imaging Results: The doctor mentions that X-rays were normal, so I'll note that as "Normal X-rays."

For the Assessment, the main issue is the stiff index finger PIP joint with limited motion and swelling. I'll list this as the current condition.

Finally, the Plan section. The doctor recommends hand therapy and a follow-up in four weeks. I'll structure this into a list with these two points.

I need to ensure all sections are filled correctly, using the default "-" where information is missing. Also, I'll maintain the JSON structure exactly as provided, ensuring no extra commentary or markdown.
