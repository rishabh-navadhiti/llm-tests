It's explicitly mentioned: \"We will start with Nicole Coffee.\" So patient name = \"Nicole Coffee\". Return as single string.\n\nChief complaint: patient is here for pain in left index finger. So chief complaint = \"pain in left index finger\". No extra.\n\nHPI Spencer: need to summarize HPI paragraph. Information: She is a previous patient, new condition. She has pain in left index finger noticed for a few months. It was bothering her when she came in for her shoulder appointment. She had a shoulder appointment, Dr. Almadroa recommended observation. She notes that it has gotten worse and not improved. She wants to know if she can have an injection now. Also exam findings show acute moderate tenderness on left index finger with an A1 polii (maybe A1 pulley). There is catching, triggering on index finger. So HPI should include onset (few months), duration (few months), location (left index finger), severity? Not given, but tenderness. Mechanism? Not given. Treatments received? No prior treatment for finger. Progression: worsened, not improved. She wants injection. So craft paragraph.\n\nMusculoskeletal verbatim: need exact dictation from doctor regarding exam. The doctor said: \"... on exam, left upper extremity skin is clean, dry, and tacky without erythema. Acute moderate tenderness on left index finger with an A1 polii. Uh, there is walking catching. There is triggering on index finger. Excellent range of motion overall. Um, on exam... Oh, uh, able to give a thumbs up, et cetera, et cetera.\" Need verbatim, no changes.

Probably include the entire phrase.\n\nImaging results: \"X-rays are three views of the finger are normal.\" So imaging result: \"X-rays are three views of the finger are normal.\" Return that.\n\nAssessment: list active problems: left index finger pain, trigger finger (A1 pulley issue). Could also include \"trigger finger\" as diagnosis. Also maybe \"shoulder issue\"? Not focus. But from transcript, assessment likely includes \"trigger finger\". And \"pain left index finger\". Provide list lines: - left index finger pain - trigger finger (left index). Keep concise.\n\nPlan: doctor said: \"plan will be, uh, plan trigger. She is not having the injection. We will do this today. X-rays are three views of the finger are normal.\" Wait that seems plan includes not injection, maybe treat with something? The dictation: \"plan will be, uh, plan trigger. She is not having the injection. We will do this today.\" Hard to interpret. But need to write exactly as dictated. So copy that phrase: \"plan will be, uh, plan trigger. She is not having the injection. We will do this today.\" Also maybe include that X-rays are normal but that's imaging. The plan includes no injection. We'll output exactly that.\n\nCheck default values: for Musculoskeletal default empty string if none, but we have.\n\nMake JSON array with objects in same order.\n\nEach object fields: title, key, content (array), default, instruction.
