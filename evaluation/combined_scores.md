# REC-6602 Score

| Title | Score (0-5)| Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The candidate note completely missed the patient's name, which is present in the benchmark note. While the name 'Linda Omansky' is not in the provided transcript, the benchmark includes it, making its absence a critical factual omission for a clinical note. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate perfectly matched the benchmark's chief complaint, 'Numbness and tingling in the right hand', and adhered to the instruction to provide only the complaint without additional details. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's output for HPI is fundamentally different in structure and content from the benchmark. While it followed its own internal instruction to list onset, duration, location, and severity, this resulted in a major content difference compared to the benchmark's comprehensive narrative HPI. Key details like the re-evaluation reason, burned thumb, difficulty feeling, and trying to hold the phone less are missing. Additionally, 'Severity: Moderate' is a hallucination not present in the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate failed to adhere strictly to the 'verbatim' instruction. It missed 'to palpation' and 'A1 pulley' for tenderness, combined 'triggering' and 'nodule' into one rephrased sentence, and included 'X-ray is clear' which, as per the benchmark's structure, belongs in the 'IMAGING_RESULTS' section. There is also a minor difference in the 'PCGs' vs 'PCTS' part compared to the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | The candidate stated 'X-ray is clear.' based on the transcript. However, the benchmark note explicitly states 'XR - Deferred.' These two statements have significantly different clinical meanings, representing a major content difference from the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's assessment lists symptoms ('Right hand numbness and tingling', 'Right thumb burn injury', 'Right small finger trigger nodule') while the benchmark provides a concise diagnosis ('Trigger finger.'). This constitutes a major content difference and a deviation from the benchmark's expected output for this field. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate captured the core treatment plan points accurately (injection, splints, nerve studies, follow-up). However, it missed some conversational details and reasoning provided in the benchmark regarding the trigger finger injection (last injection date, patient's request, doctor's agreement), which the candidate's own instructions asked for ('reflect how the provider explains the reasoning behind the treatment'). This constitutes missing minor details and partial adherence to instructions. |

**Total Score:** 13/35

**Percentage:** 37.14%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated significant weaknesses in several critical areas when compared to the benchmark. Fields like PATIENT_NAME, HPI_SPENCER, IMAGING_RESULTS, and ASSESSMENT_SPENCER showed major content discrepancies, either due to missing information, hallucination, or a fundamental difference in how information was structured or interpreted. While the CHIEF_COMPLAINT was perfect, and the PLAN_SPENCER_ captured the main points, the overall adherence to the benchmark's detailed structure and content, as well as the 'verbatim' instruction for musculoskeletal findings, was poor. The model struggles when its internal instructions lead to outputs that diverge from the established 'golden standard' clinical note format.

# REC-6612 Score

| Title | Score (0-5)| Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The transcript does not contain the patient's name. While the candidate correctly avoids hallucinating, the benchmark explicitly provides 'Susan Oakes' as the expected ground truth. Therefore, the candidate's empty content is a complete mismatch with the benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate accurately identifies the main symptoms discussed by the patient as chief complaints: 'Achiness in wrist, limited motion, and electric sensations in hand'. This aligns well with the transcript where these issues are brought up as concerns. The benchmark is slightly less comprehensive by omitting the electric sensations, which the patient explicitly asks about. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate attempts to adhere strictly to its instruction to only include Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity, which it does accurately for the symptoms themselves. However, it misses other factual content present in the benchmark, such as the patient's general well-being, difficulties, the fact she finally had nerve studies, and her specific inquiry about the nerve study results. This makes the HPI less comprehensive than the benchmark's factual content. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate precisely extracts 'Exam findings are unchanged' verbatim from the transcript, adhering perfectly to its instruction to provide verbatim physical examination findings. The benchmark's content '-' is inaccurate as the doctor did dictate specific information for this section. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | The candidate incorrectly states 'Nerve study results pending'. The transcript clearly indicates that the nerve studies have been performed, and the doctor reviews and discusses their findings (e.g., 'no evidence of carpal tunnel'). Therefore, the results are available, not pending. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate provides a factually accurate list of current medical conditions/assessments derived from the transcript, including 'Wrist achiness and limited motion', 'Electric sensations in hand', 'Possible ulnar nerve compression', and 'Cervical radiculopathy'. While the benchmark's final content for this field is empty, which is a direct mismatch, the candidate's output is relevant and adheres to its instruction to generate a list of conditions. The score is a 4 because while factually correct and following its own instructions, the benchmark's empty state implies a possible nuance or convention not fully captured, or it's a benchmark error, making a 'perfect' match complex. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate identifies the key action items accurately (activity, urology consult, follow-up, full duty). It correctly captures 'Urology consult' where the benchmark has a factual error ('Neurology consult'). However, the candidate significantly misses crucial details related to the 'discussion or education provided' and 'relevant findings or explanations discussed' as per its own instructions. Specifically, the candidate omits the detailed review of the nerve study results, including the findings of no carpal tunnel and the discussion about the ulnar nerve compression that will be watched. This makes the plan summary incomplete. |

**Total Score:** 20/35

**Percentage:** 57.14%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in extracting verbatim information where instructed and providing an accurate chief complaint. It struggled significantly with fields where the benchmark provided specific data not present in the transcript (Patient Name) or where its own instructions led to missing factual content compared to the more comprehensive benchmark (HPI, Plan). A notable factual error was identified in the Imaging Results. The candidate successfully adhered to its own formatting instructions for HPI and Assessment, producing factually correct content for those specific criteria, even when the benchmark's content was conflicting or empty.
