# REC-6602

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | Benchmark lists 'Linda Omansky', but the transcript does not mention a patient name. The candidate left the field effectively blank instead of returning '-', which is a minor formatting lapse, but we do not penalize for missing name not present in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Core complaint of right-hand numbness/tingling matches the benchmark. Candidate added burned-thumb/difficulty feeling details, which go beyond the benchmark's concise chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Accurately captures lymphoma with recent chemotherapy, increased right-hand numbness/tingling, burned right thumb causing difficulty with tasks, and trying to hold the phone less. Content aligns with the benchmark without adding unsupported details. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Not verbatim and omits details. Candidate changes phrasing (singular vs plural), omits 'A1 pulley', and renders '.PCTS' as 'PCGS are normal.' Multiple deviations from the benchmark’s exact wording. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | Benchmark states 'XR - Deferred.' Candidate reports 'X-ray clear,' which contradicts the benchmark rather than reflecting it. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Benchmark assessment lists only 'Trigger finger.' Candidate adds numbness/tingling, burned thumb, and 'carpal tunnel syndrome' (not stated as an assessment in the benchmark), introducing extra items and a probable inference. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark plan: trigger finger injection, recommend night splints, low threshold for nerve studies, and return in 2 months. Minor wording differences but identical content. |

**Total Score:** 23

**Percentage:** 65.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate captured the HPI and plan well, and the chief complaint was mostly accurate though slightly expanded. Major issues were non-verbatim musculoskeletal exam documentation, a contradictory imaging result relative to the benchmark, and an assessment that added problems not listed in the benchmark. Patient name was left blank rather than '-', but the transcript did not provide a name.

# REC-6604

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Candidate captured the name exactly as dictated in the transcript ('Nicole Coffee'). The benchmark shows a corrected spelling ('Nicole Kaffee'), which is not in the transcript; per instructions, do not penalize for benchmark-only corrections. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Content matches the benchmark meaning ('Left index finger pain') with only minor wording differences. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately summarizes duration (few months), location, worsening, and request for injection. Minor omissions and paraphrase vs benchmark (no mention of prior observation recommendation; phrased as 'worsened since her shoulder appointment'). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Verbatim capture of the dictated exam including 'tacky' skin, A1 'polii', 'walking catching', triggering, ROM, and thumbs up. Matches benchmark findings without adding or altering content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | States X-rays are normal but omits benchmark details of 'three views' and laterality ('left index finger'). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes 'Left index finger pain' and a variant of 'Trigger finger' ('Triggering'), but improperly adds a normal finding ('Excellent range of motion') which should not be in Assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Conflicts with benchmark regarding injection ('No injection today' vs plan to perform injection). Adds 'X-rays of the finger' to plan, which is not listed in the benchmark plan. Transcript language is ambiguous, but overall diverges from benchmark's intended plan. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the core complaint, HPI, and musculoskeletal exam well, with particularly strong verbatim MSK documentation. Imaging details are under-specified, the Assessment includes an inappropriate normal finding, and the Plan diverges from the benchmark regarding the injection and includes an extra item. Name matches the transcript despite a corrected spelling in the benchmark.

# REC-6605

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 3 | The transcript does not provide a patient name; the benchmark correctly uses '-'. The candidate left the field empty instead of returning '-', which is a formatting/instruction deviation rather than a factual error. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | Benchmark: 'Left small finger locking and catching.' Candidate: 'Evaluation of left small finger.' The candidate misses the key symptom details (locking/catching), reducing specificity of the complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Accurately summarizes the transcript: right-hand dominant designer, left small finger locking/catching for ~2 years, delayed care due to prior trigger finger surgeries, now seeking treatment. No extraneous exam/imaging details. Note: the benchmark mentions job impact; this was not stated in the transcript and is not penalized. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Captures the key findings: skin is purging, no erythema, moderate TTP, nodule/triggering, excellent ROM, well-healed middle finger incisions. Minor deviations from benchmark wording and omission of 'at the A1 pulley' and 'palpable' reduce precision. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Candidate: 'X-rays normal.' Benchmark: 'X-rays of the left small finger are normal.' Content is correct but less specific; minor wording difference. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Includes the correct active problem 'Left small finger locking/catching (trigger finger)' but adds non-problem items ('Well-healed trigger finger incisions' and 'Normal imaging results'), which should not appear in Assessment per instructions and are not in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | Benchmark plan: 'Planned trigger finger release. Return to clinic in 2 weeks.' Candidate includes 'Planned trigger finger procedure' (acceptable paraphrase) but adds unrelated steps from a different patient (advance ROM, video visit in one month) and omits the 2-week RTC. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60

**Overall Summary:** The candidate accurately captured the HPI and most exam and imaging findings but weakened the chief complaint and assessment with omissions and inappropriate items, respectively. The plan contains significant contamination from a different patient and misses the 2-week follow-up, markedly lowering accuracy. Formatting for the patient name field did not follow the placeholder convention.

# REC-6607

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Benchmark lists a name, but the transcript does not state the patient's name. The candidate correctly returned '-' per instructions. No penalty for benchmark-only information. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Benchmark chief complaint is 'Wrist pain.' Candidate includes wrist pain but adds extra context about discussing arthroplasty and limitations, making it less concise than the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Candidate captures knee replacement, improved synovitis after injection, osteoporosis infusion, limitation from wrist pain, and interest in right total wrist arthroplasty—consistent with the benchmark. Minor omissions (follow-up context/date) and slight inference specifying 'right wrist pain' prevent a perfect match. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Benchmark has no MSK exam text; transcript only notes 'Exam mostly unchanged.' Candidate added 'Bilateral wrist arthritis,' which is not a verbatim exam finding and belongs to assessment, not MSK exam. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | Benchmark indicates imaging mostly unchanged (with deletion of a large, poorly defined nodule). Transcript supports that imaging is unchanged. Candidate returned '-', omitting the stated imaging result. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Candidate includes 'Bilateral wrist arthritis' and 'Synovitis' matching the benchmark, plus 'Wrist pain limiting activities' and 'Osteoporosis (on infusion therapy)' which are supported by the transcript but not listed in the benchmark. Minor scope deviation. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Candidate plan to proceed with evaluation for right total wrist arthroplasty aligns with benchmark planning for right TWA. It omits 'Plan OR risks/We will proceed' phrasing and other details, so not a perfect match. |

**Total Score:** 22

**Percentage:** 62.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the core HPI and assessment items well and aligns with the planned right total wrist arthroplasty. Key weaknesses include adding non-verbatim content to the Musculoskeletal exam, missing the imaging summary, and an over-detailed chief complaint. Strengths are accurate reflection of synovitis improvement, osteoporosis infusion, and interest in wrist arthroplasty.

# REC-6608

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | Benchmark lists a name, but the transcript does not mention it. Candidate left it blank (should have used '-'); minor formatting issue but no factual error given transcript content. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Benchmark: 'Follow up for hand pain.' This is not stated in the transcript. Candidate left it empty (should have used '-'); meaning not contradicted, minor formatting deviation. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Benchmark HPI: prior injection gave no relief and patient wants to know what's going on. Candidate includes exam findings (hypopigmentation, tenderness, tests) which should not be in HPI and omits the concern statement; also misstates 'Finkelstein' as 'finger stain.' |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Core findings align (CMC hypopigmentation, first dorsal compartment tenderness, positive grind), but 'Finkelstein' is misrendered as 'finger stain' and 'still'/'to palpation' details are missing; not verbatim. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | No imaging mentioned in transcript; benchmark shows '-'. Candidate left it empty rather than '-', preserving meaning with minor formatting issue. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark assessment is 'Pain in hand.' Candidate lists persistence after injection and exam findings (incl. incorrect 'finger stain'), omitting the actual problem; major mismatch. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Benchmark: trial of de Quervain's injection and RTC in 6 weeks; candidate changed to 'dexamethasone injection' (incorrect) and omitted the note that prior injection offered no relief, though RTC timing is correct. |

**Total Score:** 20

**Percentage:** 57.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate captured some elements (exam findings broadly and return-to-clinic timing) but made significant errors: exam details were included in HPI, Finkelstein was repeatedly miswritten as 'finger stain,' the assessment omitted 'hand pain' and added exam items, and the plan changed the intended 'de Quervain's injection' to a specific medication. Missing name and chief complaint were acceptable given the transcript but formatting defaults were not followed.

# REC-6610

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | Matches the benchmark name but includes the honorific 'Miss'; minor wording difference with identical factual content. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Core complaint of left wrist pain matches; candidate adds mechanism ('after a trip and fall'), a minor extra detail beyond the benchmark phrasing. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Fully aligns with the benchmark: mechanism (trip and fall on 06/21/2025 leaving Groundlings), initial improvement, urgent care X-rays with no fracture and sprain diagnosis, worsening with Massachusetts humidity leading to visit. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark has '-', while candidate supplies an exam paragraph and also modifies wording (e.g., 'hematemosis' to 'hematoma', removes filler). Major deviation from benchmark content and from verbatim requirement. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Includes current normal left wrist X-rays, but omits the urgent care X-rays showing no fracture that are present in the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes both key problems ('Left ECU tendonitis', 'Left ulnar-sided wrist pain') matching the benchmark; omits normal findings the benchmark listed, which are minor omissions. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Exactly matches the benchmark plan items: hand therapy, MRI for further evaluation, and return after MRI. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for patient identity, chief complaint, HPI, assessment diagnoses, and plan. It misses an imaging detail (urgent care X-ray result) and diverges notably on the Musculoskeletal section by providing non-verbatim content where the benchmark had none. Overall, clinically accurate with mostly minor omissions or wording differences.

# REC-6612

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The transcript does not state the patient’s name; the candidate appropriately left it blank as per instruction. The benchmark contains a name likely from external data; per instructions, no penalty for absence when not in transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Meaning aligns with benchmark (wrist achiness and limited motion). Minor differences: candidate adds electric sensations and omits the 'follow-up' context. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate includes nerve study results (no carpal tunnel; possible ulnar compression), which are objective findings placed in the plan/assessment in the benchmark, not in the HPI. Also omits contextual details (doing okay overall; life difficult; inquiry about study results). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Candidate captures the exam statement from the transcript, but the benchmark left this section blank. Minor verbatim deviation ('Exam is unchanged' vs 'Her exam is unchanged'). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | Benchmark lists 'Nerve study results' while candidate left this field empty. The transcript references nerve studies; omission leads to a major content gap. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Candidate includes key symptoms (wrist achiness/limited motion; electric sensations), but adds diagnoses (cervical radiculopathy; ulnar nerve compression) not listed in the benchmark assessment. Not penalized for missing normal findings that are not in the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Includes follow-up and work status, and monitoring of ulnar compression. However, it omits several benchmark items (wrist doing well, gaining strength, advance activity/weightbearing, delete carpal tunnel, explicit statement of no carpal tunnel) and lists 'urology consult' instead of benchmark 'neurology consult'. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the core symptoms and some plan elements but misses or misplaces several details. HPI includes objective results that belong in plan/assessment, imaging is omitted, and the plan lacks multiple benchmark items and has a specialty mismatch. Strengths include reasonable chief complaint capture and extraction of the unchanged exam statement.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Content matches benchmark (‘Left wrist pain and masses’); only punctuation differs. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Captures key elements (night pain, two masses with locations, stability, rheumatology imaging). Adds an unsupported statement (‘no definitive diagnosis’) and omits rheumatologist’s name and ‘front of wrist’ detail. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Not verbatim and omits several details (A1 pulley findings, resisted thumb extension pain, dorsal ulnar aspect). Benchmark section is empty, but based on transcript, content is paraphrased with missing specifics. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Accurately reflects X-ray osteophyte and ultrasound findings (retinacular cyst; bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte). Minor location descriptors (dorsal aspect; superficial to first dorsal compartment sheath) are omitted. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes main problems (wrist pain, masses, osteophyte, retinacular cyst) but lacks laterality/anatomic specificity. Not penalized for benchmark-only items not evident in transcript (e.g., bilateral hand pain, right UE skin intact). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Includes night splints, observation of masses, and 6-week follow-up. Omits ‘consider aspiration vs biopsy of the wrist mass,’ which is present in the benchmark and transcript. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captures the patient’s name and chief complaint and summarizes imaging well. HPI is mostly correct but includes an unsupported statement. The musculoskeletal exam is not verbatim and misses key details. The assessment lists core problems but lacks specificity. The plan is largely correct but omits the aspiration/biopsy consideration.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Matches benchmark: Left wrist pain. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures key details (right-hand dominant social worker, pain > masses, nocturnal pain, prior diagnoses, rheumatology imaging). Omits being previously treated by Dr. Ishimori, which is in transcript and benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Benchmark left this section empty. Candidate provides accurate exam details consistent with the transcript, but not a direct match and misses some specifics (e.g., negative Finkelstein, resisted thumb extension). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Conveys all key findings (MCP osteophyte, possible avulsion vs osteophyte, retinacular cyst). Minor omissions of location specificity (dorsal aspect, ‘outside’ x-rays). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes core problems (left first dorsal compartment cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte, bilateral thumb/MCP masses). Adds 'left wrist pain' and omits ancillary items in benchmark; not penalized for benchmark-only items not in transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Includes night splints, observation, and 6-week follow-up. Omits 'aspiration vs biopsy of the wrist mass' present in benchmark and transcript; notes splints for carpal tunnel (supported by transcript) rather than 'regarding the masses' in benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 28

**Percentage:** 80

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for demographics, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging. The assessment captures the main diagnoses with minor deviations. The plan is generally correct but misses the aspiration/biopsy option. Musculoskeletal exam details are accurate to the transcript but not present in the benchmark, leading to a partial mismatch. Overall, strong fidelity with a few omissions and minor divergences.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Matches benchmark name; inclusion of honorific 'Mr.' is acceptable. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Captures the condition but adds 'injection,' which belongs to plan rather than the complaint. Meaning largely preserved. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | HPI content is missing; benchmark states left ring finger trigger finger. Major omission. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Benchmark has no MSK exam; candidate lists 'Plantar tendonitis,' which is a diagnosis, not verbatim exam findings—fabricated/incorrect for this section. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both indicate no imaging results; matches benchmark and transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes trigger finger and plantar tendonitis, but lacks laterality/digit specificity ('left ring finger') present in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Plan matches: injection for trigger finger, HEP for plantar tendonitis, low threshold for formal therapy. Benchmark also mentions RTC in 2 weeks, which is not in the transcript—no penalty per instructions. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** Accurately captured patient name and most of the plan, with largely correct assessment. Chief complaint slightly conflates plan with complaint. Major issues include missing HPI and inappropriate content in the musculoskeletal section. Imaging appropriately left as none.

| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | Matches the benchmark name but includes the honorific 'Mr.'; minor wording difference with identical identity. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Conveys 'No pain' exactly as in the benchmark; punctuation difference only. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Contains the two benchmark HPI facts (no pain; wants to know what is going on) but adds exam/imaging details not present in the benchmark HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Captures the same exam findings as the benchmark (clean pin sites, no significant tenderness, stable alignment, stiff fingers); only minor filler words and formatting differences. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Semantically identical to benchmark: X-rays unchanged from last time. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Major mismatch: benchmark lists 'Skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation,' whereas candidate lists different items ('Follow-up visit,' 'No pain,' 'Stiff fingers,' 'Parthenonic carpal stable alignment'). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Includes continuation of splint/split, X-ray review, 10-day follow-up, and transition to phenylplastic splint, but omits the benchmark's 'Referral to Eliza Cherian.' Adds 'likely pin removal or repeat X-rays,' which is in the transcript but not in the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for name, chief complaint, musculoskeletal exam, and imaging. HPI includes the correct patient-reported details but adds objective findings. The largest discrepancy is in the assessment, which does not reflect the benchmark items. The plan is mostly accurate but misses the referral to Eliza Cherian while adding extra details from the transcript.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Benchmark lists a name not stated in the transcript. Candidate correctly did not fabricate a name; per instruction, do not penalize for benchmark-only info. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Matches benchmark complaints (bilateral hand numbness, tingling, burning pain) with equivalent wording. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately captures onset (around July 1, 2025), symptom pattern, pregnancy context, OB referral for injections, and splint use with sleep impact. Omits explicit mention of the stated diagnosis in HPI found in benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Core findings match (skin CDI without erythema/ecchymosis; decreased sensation middle fingers) but not verbatim and omits the dictated 'PCTS' noted in benchmark/transcript. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | Transcript states 'X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy,' which appears in the benchmark. Candidate provided no imaging entry. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Includes 'bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome' and adds 'decreased sensation to middle fingers,' both supported by the transcript and clinically relevant. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Includes injections today and risk/temporary nature discussion, but omits splint-related context and alters follow-up by dropping the conditional 'if symptoms persist postpartum.' |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the chief complaint and HPI well, with accurate onset, pregnancy context, and treatment history. Assessment is appropriate. Key weaknesses are omission of the imaging statement (X-rays deferred), incomplete musculoskeletal verbatim (missing 'PCTS'), and a plan that changes the conditional follow-up and omits splint context. Patient name was appropriately not invented.

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly identifies the patient, key exam findings, imaging result, and largely matches the plan. It misses part of the chief complaint, omits several HPI details from the benchmark, and the assessment does not reflect the benchmark diagnosis of planned arthritis. Overall, accurate on exam and imaging, but weaker on chief complaint completeness, HPI richness, and assessment accuracy.

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the main clinical facts, including mechanism, course, imaging, and the core plan. Strengths are accurate HPI chronology and correct imaging and follow-up plan. Weaknesses include omission of 'pain' in the chief complaint, non-verbatim and incomplete musculoskeletal exam, and loss of laterality/specificity in the assessment.

**Total Score:** 10

**Percentage:** 28.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note frequently blends information from multiple patients instead of focusing on the target patient, leading to incorrect content in most sections. While the plan section contains the correct core items, it is diluted by extraneous entries. Imaging and assessment are notably mismatched with the benchmark. Overall fidelity to the benchmark is low.

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the chief complaint, HPI, and most imaging and assessment details accurately. Major miss is the patient name. The musculoskeletal section does not match the benchmark format, and the plan omits observation and same-day injection detail. Overall, clinically consistent but with notable omissions versus the benchmark.

Candidate lists DIP deformities, trapeziometacarpal tenderness, shoulder sign, etc., which pertain to a different patient and are not the verbatim findings for Cathy Smith. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | Benchmark shows no imaging reported for Cathy Smith ('-'). Candidate reports bilateral hand X-ray findings comparing to 2002 and trapeziometacarpal joint narrowing, which belong to a different case. Completely incorrect for this patient. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark assessment lists symptom-based problems: 'Hand swelling' and 'Hand pain.' Candidate lists 'Bilateral thumb CMC arthritis,' 'DIP arthritis,' and 'Moderate joint space narrowing,' which are from a different patient and do not match the benchmark problems. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Benchmark plan: continue therapy, transition care with Jack, and return in 6 weeks. Candidate includes trial of steroid injections, DIP fusion, and splints (from another case) but does match the 'Return to clinic in six weeks.' Partial overlap only on follow-up timing. |

**Total Score:** 9

**Percentage:** 25.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note appears to conflate multiple patients from the transcript. Aside from a generally similar chief complaint and matching the 6-week follow-up, most sections (HPI, MSK, imaging, assessment, and plan) pull details from other patients rather than Cathy Smith. The HPI includes exam findings and misses the patient’s therapy-related concerns and request to return to Jack. Overall, substantial mismatches with the benchmark’s content.

# REC-6645

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | Correct patient identity; minor formatting discrepancy with trailing hyphen compared to benchmark ('Nadeem Nemi-' vs 'Nadeem Nemi'). |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Conveys the same complaint as the benchmark (bilateral thumb pain); wording difference ('Evaluation of') is minor and preserves meaning. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately includes onset/progression (since 2019, worse over last six months), location, and negative numbness/tingling. Slight paraphrase ('limiting his activities' vs 'limited by his thumbs') introduces a minor inference. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Findings largely match, but laterality differs from benchmark ('bilateral' vs 'right'), and includes an extra dictation artifact ('Dot NCTS.') not in the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | Includes most elements (right-hand 3 views, Z deformity, calcific arteriogram on right, left same without calcification) but incorrectly records severity as 'moderate' instead of the corrected 'severe' in the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Captures key problems (bilateral thumb CMC arthritis, bilateral carpal tunnel, right cubital tunnel). Adds 'with progression' and omits 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' from the benchmark; otherwise aligned. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Includes trial of injections, observation for carpal/cubital tunnels, consideration of nerve studies, and 2-month follow-up. Omits counseling details on steroid temporality and rebound pain present in the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note aligns well with the benchmark on chief complaint, HPI, assessment, and main plan elements. Key weaknesses include the imaging severity error, a laterality mismatch in the musculoskeletal exam versus the benchmark, and omission of counseling details in the plan. Minor wording differences are otherwise acceptable.

# REC-6682

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark ('N. Kalinski'); explicitly stated in transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Meaning aligns with benchmark ('Left middle finger trigger finger'); candidate adds 'Recurrence of', a minor wording difference. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Includes injection on 10-22-24 and recurrence, but omits the benchmark's statement about returning to clinic if recurrence occurs, which is present in the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | No MSK exam findings in transcript; candidate left blank and benchmark used '-', which are equivalent for absence of content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging results stated; candidate returned '-', matching the benchmark's absence. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Clinically consistent with benchmark (trigger finger of left middle finger); candidate adds 'recurrence', a minor wording difference. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark plan: injection performed today and return if recurrence. |

**Total Score:** 31

**Percentage:** 88.57

**Overall Summary:** Strong overall alignment with the benchmark. The candidate accurately captured the patient's name, plan, imaging status, and lack of MSK findings. Minor wording differences in the chief complaint and assessment, and a missed sentence in the HPI regarding follow-up lowered the score slightly. Otherwise, content was factual and clinically relevant.
