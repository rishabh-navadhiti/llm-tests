  "total_score": 20,
  "percentage": 57.14,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate captured some elements (exam findings broadly and return-to-clinic timing) but made significant errors: exam details were included in HPI, Finkelstein was repeatedly miswritten as 'finger stain,' the assessment omitted 'hand pain' and added exam items, and the plan changed the intended 'de Quervain's injection' to a specific medication. Missing name and chief complaint were acceptable given the transcript but formatting defaults were not followed."
