      "score": 4,

      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Includes night splints, observation, and 6-week follow-up. Omits 'aspiration vs biopsy of the wrist mass' present in benchmark and transcript; notes splints for carpal tunnel (supported by transcript) rather than 'regarding the masses' in benchmark."

  "total_score": 28,
  "percentage": 80,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for demographics, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging. The assessment captures the main diagnoses with minor deviations. The plan is generally correct but misses the aspiration/biopsy option. Musculoskeletal exam details are accurate to the transcript but not present in the benchmark, leading to a partial mismatch. Overall, strong fidelity with a few omissions and minor divergences."
