      "justification": "Captures follow-up, improved forearm pain, and severe thumb pain. Omits details in benchmark about wanting guidance for thumb pain and the daughter's wedding/hand use context; overall pain assessment ('better but overall the same') also missing."

      "score": 4,

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note correctly identifies the patient, key exam findings, imaging result, and largely matches the plan. It misses part of the chief complaint, omits several HPI details from the benchmark, and the assessment does not reflect the benchmark diagnosis of planned arthritis. Overall, accurate on exam and imaging, but weaker on chief complaint completeness, HPI richness, and assessment accuracy."
