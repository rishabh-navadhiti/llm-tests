      "justification": "Mentions correct reason for splint removal but mixes in exam findings (pain/limited flexion) and other patients' histories, diverging from the benchmark focused solely on splint contamination and questions."

    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Not verbatim and includes findings from multiple patients; changes 'with sutures' to 'with sutures removed' and adds unrelated DIP/PIP and other exam items."

  "percentage": 28.57,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note frequently blends information from multiple patients instead of focusing on the target patient, leading to incorrect content in most sections. While the plan section contains the correct core items, it is diluted by extraneous entries. Imaging and assessment are notably mismatched with the benchmark. Overall fidelity to the benchmark is low."
