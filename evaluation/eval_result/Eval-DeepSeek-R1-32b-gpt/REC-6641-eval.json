  "overall_summary": "The candidate note partially reflects Kathy Smith’s visit but is diluted by inclusion of details from two other patients. It misses key elements (return to Jack), fabricates imaging, and adds unrelated diagnoses. Strengths include partial capture of symptoms and some exam details; however, adherence to single-patient context and exact plan details is poor."
