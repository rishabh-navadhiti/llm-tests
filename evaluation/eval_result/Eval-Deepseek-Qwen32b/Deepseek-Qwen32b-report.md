# REC-6602 Score

| Title | Score (0-5)| Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The benchmark note explicitly contains the patient name 'Linda Omansky'. The candidate note returns only '-', indicating a complete failure to extract or include the patient's name as present in the ground truth. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate note perfectly matches the chief complaint 'Numbness and tingling in the right hand' found in the benchmark and accurately extracted from the transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate note's HPI format (Onset, Duration, Location, Severity) and content are vastly different from the benchmark's comprehensive narrative HPI. While some extracted points are accurate, it misses significant details such as the reevaluation purpose, the burned thumb, difficulty with earrings, and trying to hold the phone less, which are all present in the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate missed specific details like 'A1 pulley' for the tenderness. Crucially, it incorrectly included 'X-ray is clear' within the musculoskeletal findings, which is an imaging result and not a physical exam finding, violating the field's intended content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | The candidate note states 'X-ray is clear.' based on the transcript. However, the benchmark note, considered the ground truth, explicitly states 'XR - Deferred.', indicating a significant factual difference. The benchmark's history shows this was a human correction from 'X-ray is clear'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate provides a list of symptoms/conditions ('Right hand numbness and tingling', 'Right thumb burn injury', 'Right small finger trigger nodule') which are factually relevant but do not match the benchmark's concise and single diagnosis of 'Trigger finger.'. The benchmark demonstrates a higher level of clinical abstraction that the candidate did not replicate. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate captured the core plan points (injection, splints, nerve studies, follow-up). However, it lacked the conversational context and specific details present in the benchmark regarding the trigger finger injection (e.g., last injection date, patient's desire, doctor's agreement). The overall flow is less conversational than the benchmark's plan. |

**Total Score:** 14/35

**Percentage:** 40.0%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in accurately extracting the Chief Complaint. However, its overall performance was significantly hampered by deviations from the benchmark's content, format, and level of detail across most other fields. Key issues include missing crucial information (e.g., patient name, HPI narrative details), including irrelevant information in fields (e.g., X-ray in Musculoskeletal), and failing to match the precise and often more clinically abstracted content of the benchmark (e.g., Imaging, Assessment, Plan context). The candidate frequently adhered to its internal instructions, but these instructions did not always align with the benchmark's established ground truth, leading to lower scores.

| Title | Score (0-5)| Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | The candidate note transcribed the name as 'Nicole Coffee' which was dictated in the transcript. However, the benchmark note, which is the ground truth, corrected the spelling to 'Nicole Kaffee'. This is a minor spelling difference but deviates from the established benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate note states 'Pain in left index finger' while the benchmark states 'Left index finger pain'. Both accurately capture the chief complaint, with only a minor wording difference. The meaning is perfectly preserved. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note adhered strictly to its internal instruction to only provide Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity. While accurate for these specific points, it missed significant clinically relevant details present in the benchmark note and transcript, such as the patient's prior shoulder appointment, Dr. Almadroa's previous recommendation for observation, and the patient's current request for an injection. This constitutes multiple missing details compared to the comprehensive benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note performed exceptionally well, providing a highly verbatim transcription of the musculoskeletal exam findings as dictated. It even included 'Able to give a thumbs up' which was dictated but missing from the benchmark, and maintained verbatim phrasing like 'tacky' and 'walking catching' where the benchmark showed slight interpretation/standardization. This perfectly aligns with its instruction to be verbatim. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | The candidate note states 'X-rays of the finger are normal'. The benchmark note is more detailed and closer to the transcript, stating 'Three views of the left index finger X-rays are normal.'. The candidate missed the detail 'three views' and the implicit 'left index'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate note provided 'Left index finger pain with triggering'. While factually correct, the benchmark provided two separate, clinically distinct items: 'Left index finger pain' and 'Trigger finger'. The candidate's combined statement is less precise in terms of typical medical assessment structure, but still conveys the core issues. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate note includes 'Follow-up in 6 to 8 weeks', which is a significant hallucination as this detail was not mentioned anywhere in the transcript. Additionally, 'Perform trigger release without injection' is an interpretation; the transcript states 'plan trigger' and 'She is not having the injection. We will do this today.' The benchmark accurately reflects the dictated information without adding unsubstantiated details. |

**Total Score:** 23/35

**Percentage:** 65.71%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates mixed performance. It achieved excellent accuracy in the 'MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM' field by adhering strictly to its verbatim instruction, even surpassing the benchmark's fidelity to the transcript in some aspects. However, its performance was significantly hindered by crucial omissions in 'HPI_SPENCER' due to an overly restrictive internal instruction, and a major hallucination in 'PLAN_SPENCER_' regarding follow-up details not present in the transcript. Other fields showed minor discrepancies in wording or completeness compared to the benchmark, indicating room for improvement in consistently capturing all relevant details and avoiding fabrication.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Both the candidate note and the benchmark note correctly indicate that the patient's name was not specified in the transcript for the primary patient being documented. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | The candidate's chief complaint 'Evaluation of left small finger' is too general. The transcript clearly states the specific reason for evaluation: 'He states that he first noticed locking and catching about two years ago.' The benchmark accurately captures 'Left small finger locking and catching', which is the actual chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate strictly adhered to its specific instruction to only provide 'Onset, duration, location and severity' for the HPI. All details provided (Onset: Two years ago, Location: Left small finger, Severity: Not specified) are factually correct based on the transcript. 'Duration: Ongoing' is a reasonable inference. The candidate perfectly followed its given constraints for this field. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate perfectly adhered to the instruction 'Must be extract what doctor has dictated, Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.' It included filler words ('In fact,', 'Um,') and the exact phrasing 'aim of fluid is nodule that is triggering' as spoken by the doctor. While the benchmark presented a clinically refined version, the candidate successfully met the specific verbatim requirement. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate correctly states 'X-rays are normal for the finger'. However, the benchmark 'X-rays of the left small finger are normal' is more specific by identifying 'left small finger'. This is a minor omission of detail, but the core meaning is preserved. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Both the candidate ('Left small finger trigger finger') and the benchmark ('Trigger finger (left small finger)') accurately and concisely state the patient's assessment. The meaning is identical. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate's plan, 'Proceed with trigger finger release surgery on the left small finger,' accurately reflects the plan for the first patient ('finger plan will be, uh, planned trigger'). The benchmark incorrectly includes 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks,' which was a follow-up instruction for a *different* patient later in the transcript. The candidate correctly avoided this misattribution, demonstrating higher factual accuracy for the intended patient, despite its own instruction asking for follow-up (which wasn't present for this specific patient). |

**Total Score:** 31/35

**Percentage:** 88.57%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed strongly, especially in adhering to specific field instructions for HPI and Musculoskeletal verbatim extraction. It accurately identified the patient's name, assessment, and the primary plan of action, notably avoiding a misattributed follow-up instruction present in the benchmark. The main area for improvement was the 'Chief Complaint,' which was too generic, and a minor lack of specificity in the 'Imaging Results' field.

# REC-6607 Score

| Title | Score (0-5)| Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The candidate note completely failed to identify the patient's name, which is a critical piece of information. The benchmark note correctly identifies 'Susan Shell' despite it not being explicitly mentioned in the provided transcript, implying it's either pre-filled or derived from other context not provided here. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The chief complaint 'Wrist pain' is accurate. However, the candidate added 'significantly limiting activities', which, while factually correct from the transcript, adds a detail that the instruction explicitly asked to avoid ('without any additional details or context'). The benchmark kept it concise as 'Wrist pain'. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate note failed to extract any HPI information. Even according to its own strict instruction ('Onset, duration, location and severity on the illness'), it should have captured at least the location (right wrist) and severity ('significantly limited by her wrist pain') from the transcript. The benchmark note provides a comprehensive and accurate HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The candidate note completely failed to provide musculoskeletal physical examination findings as explicitly instructed ('What is the physical examination finding... Must be verbatim.'). Instead, it included a diagnosis ('Bilateral wrist arthritis') and a plan ('Right total wrist arthroplasty planned'), neither of which are physical exam findings. The benchmark correctly left this field blank, as the only exam mention ('Exam mostly unchanged, except you can delete the large, poorly defined nodule') was to be deleted or was not suitable for a verbatim entry here. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The candidate note completely missed the imaging results. The doctor explicitly stated, 'The imaging you can leave all the same,' which the benchmark accurately summarized as 'Imaging mostly unchanged'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note correctly identified 'Bilateral wrist arthritis' and 'Synovitis', and accurately noted 'Synovitis (improved)'. However, it failed to include 'Osteoporosis' as a current medical condition, despite the patient actively receiving an infusion for it. This is a significant omission given the instruction to list all relevant 'current medical conditions'. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | While the candidate correctly identified the primary treatment plan ('Plan for right total wrist arthroplasty.'), it hallucinated a follow-up time ('Follow-up in 6 to 8 weeks') that was not mentioned in the transcript. The phrase 'Discuss procedure and benefits with patient' is also an inference not directly stated by the doctor in the provided transcript. Hallucinating information significantly detracts from the note's reliability. |

**Total Score:** 7/35

**Percentage:** 20.0%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed poorly across multiple fields. It completely failed to extract critical information for Patient Name, HPI, and Imaging Results. Significant inaccuracies and hallucinations were present in the Musculoskeletal Exam (listing diagnoses/plans instead of exam findings) and the Plan (inventing a follow-up time). While it correctly identified the Chief Complaint and partially captured the Assessment, the pervasive omissions and hallucinations indicate a lack of robust information extraction and adherence to field-specific instructions.

# REC-6608 Score

| Title | Score (0-5)| Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The benchmark note includes 'Sandra Herrara' as the patient name, which is considered the ground truth. The candidate note returns '-', indicating no patient name was identified. This is a complete factual miss compared to the benchmark, even if the name was not explicitly stated in the provided transcript snippet. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | The benchmark's 'Follow up for hand pain' is a more appropriate and general chief complaint. The candidate's 'Injection did not offer any relief' is too specific and functions more as an HPI detail or a reason for the visit rather than the overarching chief complaint. It misses the broader context of the patient's complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The benchmark correctly extracts key HPI information: 'She reports previous injection did not offer any relief. She wants to know what is going on.' The candidate note returns '-', indicating a complete failure to capture relevant HPI content that was present in the transcript and deemed necessary by the benchmark (ground truth). While the candidate's internal instructions were very specific, the benchmark still serves as the ground truth for content inclusion. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate note missed a significant detail from the transcript: 'Mild over the first dorsal compartment,' which the benchmark accurately interpreted as 'Mild tenderness to palpation over the first dorsal compartment.' Additionally, the candidate incorrectly combined 'Positive finger stain and grind' and did not interpret 'finger stain' as 'Finkelstein,' which the benchmark correctly did. While the candidate's instruction was 'verbatim,' it was not perfectly verbatim ('CMC during' vs 'CMC joint') and more importantly, missed substantial clinical information present in the transcript compared to the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging results were mentioned in the transcript. Both the benchmark and candidate notes correctly reflect this by returning '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The benchmark provides a concise and accurate assessment of the patient's underlying condition: 'Pain in hand.' The candidate's response, 'Injection did not offer any relief,' describes a historical event or treatment outcome rather than the current medical condition itself, which is more appropriate for the HPI section. It does not align with the instruction to list 'current medical conditions.' |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate note misses the contextual statement 'Her previous injection offered no relief,' which the benchmark correctly includes as part of the plan's rationale. The candidate also transcribes 'dig verban's injection' verbatim instead of correcting it to 'de Quervain's injection,' which the benchmark accurately provides as the clinically correct term. Additionally, the candidate used 'six' instead of the numerical '6' for the follow-up time, which is a minor formatting deviation from its own instruction 'User numbers instead of word where necessary'. |

**Total Score:** 12/35

**Percentage:** 34.285714285714285%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed poorly, demonstrating significant inaccuracies and omissions compared to the benchmark. It failed to identify crucial information such as the patient's name and HPI details present in the ground truth. Its interpretations for Chief Complaint and Assessment were more aligned with HPI, indicating a misunderstanding of these distinct clinical sections. The Musculoskeletal section was incomplete and lacked clinical refinement found in the benchmark. Furthermore, the Plan section omitted important contextual information and failed to correct a common medical mispronunciation, highlighting a weakness in clinical accuracy and adherence to a comprehensive scribe-style output.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The benchmark note includes 'Susan Oakes' for the patient's name. The candidate note left this field empty, despite the benchmark containing this information. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The candidate note listed specific symptoms ('Achiness in wrist, limited motion, and electric sensations in hand') as the chief complaint. While these are accurate symptoms, the benchmark note more precisely identifies the chief complaint as a 'Follow-up for wrist achiness and limited motion,' reflecting the nature of the visit as a follow-up for pre-existing issues. The candidate missed the 'follow-up' aspect, which is a key part of the chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate adhered to its specific instruction to focus on onset, duration, location, and severity, providing a structured HPI. It correctly identified stable symptoms, location (wrist and hand), and severity (achiness and electric sensations). However, it missed broader narrative details present in the benchmark HPI (which is a more direct transcription), such as the patient's general well-being and her direct question about the nerve study results. It also implied 'since last visit' which wasn't explicitly stated, though 'stable' was. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate accurately extracted the verbatim phrase 'Her exam is unchanged' from the transcript, perfectly adhering to the instruction to provide verbatim physical examination findings. The benchmark having '-' is a discrepancy with the transcript, making the candidate's output superior in adherence to the provided audio. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | The candidate incorrectly stated 'Nerve study results pending'. The transcript clearly indicates that the doctor reviewed the nerve studies and discussed specific findings ('no evidence of carpal tunnel', 'evidence of ulnar nerve compression'), meaning the results are not pending but have been reviewed. The benchmark correctly lists 'Nerve study results' without implying pendency. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate accurately listed the active medical conditions/symptoms based on the transcript: 'Wrist achiness and limited motion', 'Electric sensations in hand', 'Possible ulnar nerve compression', and 'Cervical radiculopathy'. It correctly excluded normal exam findings as per its instructions. This aligns well with the expected content for this section, which was partially derived from the benchmark's `history.data` for this initially blank field. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate's plan is significantly abbreviated compared to the benchmark and the comprehensive details mentioned in the transcript. It missed several key components such as the context ('Regarding the wrist', 'Regarding the cervical radiculopathy'), details about the patient's progress ('She is doing well', 'She is continuing to gain strength'), the instruction to 'delete the carpal tunnel,' and specific findings from the nerve studies relevant to the plan ('no evidence of carpal tunnel', 'evidence of ulnar nerve compression... but she is not symptomatic in that distribution, we will watch this for now'). Additionally, it transcribed 'Urology consult' verbatim, which is a likely clinical misstatement for 'neurology consult' given the context of radiculopathy, and the benchmark corrected this for clinical accuracy. |

**Total Score:** 19/35

**Percentage:** 54.28%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strength in accurately extracting verbatim information when specifically instructed, as seen in the Musculoskeletal section. It also performed well in generating a concise assessment based on active symptoms. However, its performance was significantly hampered by missing crucial details in the HPI and Plan sections, leading to an incomplete clinical picture. A major factual inaccuracy was noted in the Imaging Results (incorrectly stating 'pending') and a clinically questionable verbatim transcription in the Plan ('Urology consult' instead of 'Neurology consult' for radiculopathy), which the benchmark corrected. The complete omission of patient name, though not present in the transcript, was a direct mismatch with the benchmark, impacting the overall score.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Perfect match in factual content and adherence to instructions. The patient's name is accurately extracted. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Perfect match in factual content and adherence to instructions. The chief complaint is accurately identified without additional details. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | While the candidate followed its internal instruction to focus on Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity, it significantly deviates from the benchmark's comprehensive narrative HPI. It is missing several important details present in the benchmark, such as the fluctuation of the masses and the patient consulting a rheumatologist who ordered imaging. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The benchmark note explicitly states '-' for this field, indicating no relevant content or that the information should not be included here as per the ground truth. The candidate note, however, provides a detailed verbatim transcription of musculoskeletal exam findings. This constitutes a complete mismatch with the benchmark, even though the candidate's content is factually present in the transcript. The benchmark is considered the ground truth. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Minor wording and formatting differences, such as the omission of 'Outside' for X-rays and merging ultrasound findings into a single sentence. However, all factual content from the benchmark is present, and the meaning is perfectly preserved. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate accurately identifies the two primary medical conditions (Left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst and Left thumb MCP joint osteophyte) with only minor wording differences ('joint'). It omits 'Bilateral hand pain' which is in the benchmark (though its clarity in the transcript is ambiguous). The candidate correctly omits 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' (which has a factual laterality error in the benchmark) and 'No tenderness to palpation', which are generally considered normal exam findings, not primary diagnoses for an assessment list. Given the core conditions are present and some benchmark items are debatable, this is a strong match. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate missed a critical and explicit instruction from the doctor regarding the plan: 'Consider aspiration versus biopsy of the wrist mass.' This is a significant omission, although other plan items are well-captured and presented in a conversational tone. |

**Total Score:** 23/35

**Percentage:** 65.71%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed well on straightforward fields like Patient Name and Chief Complaint. It accurately extracted Imaging Results with minor formatting differences. The Assessment section captured the primary diagnoses effectively, despite some questionable content in the benchmark. However, the note significantly struggled with the HPI, providing a highly condensed version due to its restrictive internal instructions, and critically failed on the Musculoskeletal Verbatim section by providing content where the benchmark specified none. A major omission was also noted in the Plan field, where a key medical procedure was missed. The internal instructions for the candidate sometimes led to deviations from the benchmark's expected output, which impacted scoring negatively where the benchmark was considered absolute ground truth.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The candidate note perfectly matched the patient's name as provided in the benchmark and transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate note accurately identified 'Left wrist pain' as the chief complaint, matching the benchmark and adhering to the instruction for conciseness. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | While the candidate note adhered to its internal instruction to only list onset, duration, location, and severity, it significantly missed extensive factual content present in the benchmark HPI, including patient demographics, prior treatments, diagnoses, and previous consultations/imaging. This constitutes multiple missing details compared to the comprehensive benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The benchmark note explicitly states '-' for this field, indicating no content is expected. The candidate note, however, provided a detailed list of musculoskeletal findings, which, although mostly accurate from the transcript, is a complete mismatch with the benchmark's content for this field. Therefore, it is considered completely incorrect in the context of matching the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate note accurately captured the primary imaging findings. There was a minor difference in the specificity of the retinacular cyst location ('in the wrist' vs. 'superficial to the first dorsal compartment sheath' in the benchmark), but the overall meaning of the findings was preserved. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note missed 'Bilateral thumb and MCP joint masses,' which was a stated diagnosis in the transcript and present in the benchmark. Additionally, it omitted normal exam findings ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.') which were present in the benchmark, despite conflicting instructions within the candidate note itself. 'Left wrist pain' is a symptom rather than a diagnosis in this context. These are multiple missing details. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate note correctly identified night splints, observation for masses, and follow-up time. However, it entirely missed a crucial part of the plan: 'Aspiration versus biopsy of the wrist mass.' This is a major content difference and omission from the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 20/35

**Percentage:** 57.14%

**Overall Summary:** The AI-generated note demonstrated strong performance in extracting basic patient information like name and chief complaint. However, its overall quality was significantly hampered by major omissions and discrepancies in more complex sections such as the History of Present Illness, Assessment, and Plan. A notable issue arose with the Musculoskeletal field, where the candidate note provided content while the benchmark indicated an empty field, leading to a complete mismatch. The candidate's adherence to its internal, sometimes overly restrictive, instructions often resulted in an incomplete note when compared to the comprehensive golden standard, highlighting a need for improved alignment between internal model instructions and desired output completeness.

| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | The candidate note includes 'Mr.' which is not present in the benchmark, although the core patient name is correct. The instruction implied to only return the name itself without titles. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Perfect match with the benchmark note and accurately reflects the chief complaint from the transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate note returned '-', indicating no information, while the benchmark correctly extracted 'He reports left ring finger trigger finger' from the transcript, which is the HPI for the patient. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The instruction for this field specifically asks for 'physical examination finding... Must be extract what doctor has dictated, Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.' The doctor did not dictate any physical examination findings. 'Plantar tendonitis' is a diagnosis/assessment, not a physical exam finding. Therefore, the candidate note's inclusion of 'Plantar tendonitis' is incorrect for this specific field, while the benchmark correctly uses '-' |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both the candidate and benchmark notes correctly indicate no imaging results relevant to Kevin Clancy, as the mentioned imaging finding was for 'David'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note missed one of the two primary assessments. It only listed 'Left ring finger trigger finger' and failed to include 'Plantar tendonitis', which was clearly stated by the doctor. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate note is missing significant details from the plan. It omitted the 'Left ring finger trigger finger injection' and the 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks' follow-up, only capturing the plan for plantar tendonitis. |

**Total Score:** 17/35

**Percentage:** 48.57%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed well in identifying the chief complaint and correctly noting the absence of relevant imaging results. However, it significantly struggled with the HPI, Musculoskeletal exam findings (hallucinating/misclassifying information), Assessment, and Plan fields. There were critical omissions in the Assessment and Plan, and the HPI was completely missed. The inclusion of 'Mr.' in the patient name was a minor deviation from the strict benchmark. Overall, the note suffers from significant factual incompleteness and misinterpretation of field instructions.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Perfect match in factual content and adherence to instructions. The patient's name 'Parviz Mikael' was correctly extracted. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The candidate included 'seeking update on condition' in addition to 'No pain'. The instruction was to provide 'only the patient's chief complaint without any additional details or context', which the benchmark 'No pain' correctly adhered to. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate completely failed to extract any relevant HPI information from the transcript ('he states that he has no pain. He wants to know, uh, what is going on.') and returned the default placeholder '-'. The benchmark correctly captured this information. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | The candidate's output is largely verbatim, matching the benchmark closely. A minor difference is the use of 'and' to combine 'parthenonic carpal stable alignment' and 'stiff fingers' into a single phrase, whereas the benchmark and transcript treated 'stiff fingers' as a slightly separate observation. This is a minor wording difference but slightly deviates from strict verbatim adherence. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Perfect match in factual content and adherence to instructions. The imaging result 'X-rays are the same as the last time' was correctly extracted. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's output ('Stiff fingers', 'Parthenonic carpal stable alignment') significantly differs from the benchmark's ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.'). Despite the candidate's instruction being contradictory, the benchmark's content aligns with the specific latter rules given to the candidate ('If skin is intact say 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.'. - If no tendon palpation. say ' No tenderness to palpation. '). The candidate failed to follow these specific templated instructions and instead included exam findings which contradict other general rules in its own instructions ('Do not include any exam findings'). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate comprehensively captured all key elements of the plan, often providing more detail and accuracy for the follow-up instructions than the benchmark. It correctly parsed the 'plexal ligament split' options and included precise details for the 10-day follow-up including pin removal/repeat X-rays and splint transition. The 'Consult with Eliza Cherian' is also a suitable interpretation of 'we're gonna go see Eliza Cherian'. |

**Total Score:** 23/35

**Percentage:** 65.71428571428571%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in extracting straightforward information such as patient name, imaging results, and a highly detailed plan, often surpassing the benchmark's completeness in the latter. However, it exhibited significant weaknesses in the HPI, completely omitting relevant information, and in the Chief Complaint by including extraneous details. The Assessment section was particularly problematic due to conflicting internal instructions and a failure to align with the specific templated phrases present in the benchmark, resulting in a low score for that field. The Musculoskeletal section was accurate but had a minor deviation from strict verbatim transcription.

| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The benchmark note includes the patient's name, 'Eliza Asherian', which is considered the ground truth. The candidate note returned '-' for this field, failing to provide the correct patient name from the benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate note 'Bilateral hand numbness, tingling, and burning pain.' perfectly matches the content and intent of the benchmark note 'Bilateral hand numbness and tingling, and burning pain' and accurately reflects the chief complaint from the transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | While the candidate note followed its own instruction to only provide Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity, it significantly missed clinically relevant details present in the benchmark note and transcript. Key omissions include the patient's profession/location, the referral from OB, the context of previous pregnancy symptoms beyond intensity, and the diagnosis of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome which is often included in HPI for context. The HPI in the candidate note is far less comprehensive than the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | The candidate note accurately extracted the key musculoskeletal findings verbatim from the transcript ('Bilateral upper extremity skin is clean, dry, and intact without erythema or ecchymosis. Decreased sensation to the middle fingers noted.'). It omitted the ambiguous '.PCTS' present in the benchmark, which was not clearly dictated. Minor formatting differences compared to the benchmark (e.g., combining sentences rather than separate lines), but meaning is preserved and largely verbatim. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate note 'X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy.' is a perfect, verbatim match to the benchmark note and the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate note 'Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.' perfectly matches the benchmark note and accurately reflects the diagnosis mentioned in the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate note missed several important details in the plan. It omitted the information about the patient already wearing splints without enough improvement to sleep through the night, which the benchmark included. Additionally, while it mentioned discussing risks and temporary nature, it missed the explicit statement that injections 'will do them today' and 'she understands' which were present in the benchmark and transcript. |

**Total Score:** 24/35

**Percentage:** 68.57142857142857%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in fields requiring direct and concise extraction, such as Chief Complaint, Imaging Results, and Assessment. The Musculoskeletal verbatim section was also well-handled, capturing essential details accurately. However, the note suffered significantly due to a complete omission of the patient's name (which was in the benchmark) and a notably sparse History of Present Illness (HPI) section, where the model's strict instructions led to the exclusion of important contextual and narrative details present in the benchmark. The Plan section also missed key information regarding prior treatment and specific details about the planned injections. This highlights a need for more robust instruction following or better instruction design for complex clinical sections where comprehensive detail is expected.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate added 'following laceration' which is additional context not present in the concise benchmark chief complaint. Meaning is preserved, but there's a minor difference in conciseness. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate strictly followed its own instruction to only provide onset, duration, location, and severity. However, this results in a highly condensed HPI that lacks the comprehensive narrative and details present in the benchmark, leading to a major content difference from the golden standard HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate's output for this field is highly accurate and adheres closely to the verbatim instruction provided to it. Minor differences from the benchmark (e.g., 'PIP' vs 'proximal interphalangeal joint', 'Stiff' vs 'Very stiff', missing 'at this time') are negligible. For 'No sensory tenderness to palpation' and 'remaining digit', the candidate is more verbatim to the transcript than the benchmark, aligning perfectly with its own instructions. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate's 'Normal X-rays' preserves the meaning of the benchmark's 'X-rays are normal.' with only minor wording differences. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate combined 'stiff index finger PIP joint with limited motion and swelling' into a single item. Crucially, it omitted 'Laceration of the left index finger' as a distinct assessment, which is present and relevant in the benchmark. This represents a missing key detail. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate missed the initial 'Plan proximal interphalangeal' phrase present in the benchmark (which itself is a slightly expanded version of the doctor's 'Plan PIP'). For the follow-up, the candidate's 'follow-up evaluation' is less specific than the benchmark's 'followup with range of motion check'. This indicates partial adherence and some missing details. |

**Total Score:** 19/35

**Percentage:** 54.28571428571429%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strength in fields requiring verbatim extraction, particularly the Musculoskeletal Exam, where it closely followed its own instructions and matched the transcript well. However, its overall performance was significantly hampered by its inability to extract the patient's name and its overly restrictive internal instructions for the HPI field, which led to a major content mismatch compared to the comprehensive benchmark. Additionally, the Assessment field showed a notable omission, and the Plan field was less detailed than the benchmark. The key weakness lies in the discrepancy between adherence to internal, sometimes too narrow, instructions and producing a clinically complete note that aligns with a comprehensive golden standard.

| Title | Score (0-5)| Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | The candidate correctly identified 'Chaz Thomas'. However, the benchmark note is structured for a single patient, implying only one patient name is expected. The candidate provided a list of all patients mentioned in the transcript, which, while factually correct for the entire transcript, deviates from the implied single-patient context of the benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The benchmark states the chief complaint concisely as 'Follow-up'. The candidate provided 'Follow-up for splint removal and concerns about blood exposure'. The instruction for this field was to provide 'only the patient's chief complaint without any additional details or context', which the candidate failed to fully adhere to by adding extra context. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's instruction for HPI was to provide 'Onset, duration, location and severity'. While the candidate attempted to follow this format, the content provided ('Onset: Yesterday; Duration: Recent; Location: Splint area; Severity: Mild pain with limited flexion') significantly deviates from the narrative HPI provided in the benchmark and the transcript. Specifically, 'Mild pain with limited flexion' is an exam finding, not part of the HPI, and 'Duration' and 'Location' are inferences not explicitly stated in the HPI section of the transcript for Chaz Thomas. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | The candidate's output 'Laceration clean, dry, intact with sutures; sutures removed today; tolerating well; limited flexion' differs from the benchmark 'Laceration, clean dry and intact with sutures. Excellent, thumbs up but some pain, limited flexion.' The candidate correctly includes 'sutures removed today; tolerating well' which were dictated but missing from the benchmark. However, the candidate omits 'Excellent, thumbs up but some pain' which is present in the benchmark. Due to these discrepancies, it's a partial match against the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both the candidate and benchmark correctly indicate no imaging results ('-') for this patient. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's assessment ('Splint-related concerns; limited flexion') is entirely different from the benchmark's ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.'). While the benchmark's content contains a potential factual error from the transcript ('No tenderness to palpation' vs 'some pain'), the evaluation is strictly against the benchmark as the ground truth. Therefore, the candidate's output is considered a major content difference. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate incorrectly included 'Sutures removed today' as part of the plan. This was an exam finding from the transcript, not a plan item. The rest of the plan items ('transition to removable splint; hand therapy; follow-up in two weeks') are consistent with the benchmark and transcript. The inclusion of an incorrect detail lowers the score. |

**Total Score:** 20/35

**Percentage:** 57.14%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note achieved varying levels of accuracy across the fields. It performed well in identifying the patient and the absence of imaging results. However, it struggled significantly with the 'HPI Spencer' and 'Assessment Spencer' fields, where its content and format deviated substantially from the benchmark, indicating issues with instruction adherence and factual mapping. The 'Chief Complaint', 'Musculoskeletal Verbatim', and 'Plan Spencer' fields had minor inaccuracies or omissions compared to the benchmark, preventing perfect scores. The candidate's internal contradictions in instructions for 'Assessment' also highlighted difficulties in defining expected output.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | The candidate correctly identified 'Kathy Smith' but incorrectly included names of other patients ('Brigitte Metman', 'Samar Actrion') who are not the subject of this specific note, indicating a failure to adhere to single-patient context. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | For Kathy Smith, the candidate identified 'Unhappy with hand therapy' which is a secondary complaint, but missed the primary chief complaints of 'Swelling and pain in hand' and 'Follow up for hand surgery'. It also incorrectly included chief complaints for other patients discussed in the transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate completely failed to extract the HPI relevant to Kathy Smith, instead providing HPI details for other patients. It did not capture her current status (doing okay overall, still swelling and pain) or her dissatisfaction with therapy, failing to meet the instruction for onset, duration, location, and severity for Kathy Smith. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate correctly extracted a verbatim phrase ('Minimal scar, some continued tenderness to palpation at A1 pulley incision') relevant to Kathy Smith. However, it missed several other significant verbatim findings for Kathy Smith (e.g., incisions well healed, full fist, moderate soft tissue swelling, excellent range of motion, continued pain with motion) and included irrelevant findings from other patients. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | For Kathy Smith, no imaging results were discussed in her section of the transcript, which is correctly represented by '-' in the benchmark. The candidate incorrectly listed imaging results pertinent to other patients, making the information irrelevant and incorrect for this patient's note. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate included 'Recovering from surgery' which is conceptually similar to 'Status post hand surgery'. However, it failed to include 'Swelling' and 'Pain' as active issues for Kathy Smith. It also incorrectly included assessments for other patients. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate correctly identified 'Continue therapy' for Kathy Smith. However, it completely missed the crucial specifics of 'Return to Jack for hand therapy' and 'Return to clinic in 6 weeks'. It also incorrectly included plans for other patients. |

**Total Score:** 8/35

**Percentage:** 22.857142857142858%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated a significant misunderstanding of context by generating content for multiple patients present in the transcript rather than focusing solely on the patient relevant to the benchmark note (Kathy Smith). This led to substantial irrelevant information being included in almost every field. For the actual patient, the note was consistently incomplete, missing critical details in the HPI, Chief Complaint, Musculoskeletal exam, Assessment, and Plan fields. While it managed to extract a few accurate fragments for the target patient, the overall performance is severely impacted by this fundamental error in scope and content selection.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The PATIENT_NAME is a perfect, exact match to the benchmark and the transcript, fully adhering to instructions. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The CHIEF_COMPLAINT is a perfect, exact match to the benchmark and accurately reflects the patient's chief complaint from the transcript, adhering to instructions. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate note perfectly adheres to its specific instruction to only provide Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity. It accurately extracts these details from the transcript, even though the benchmark included additional information not requested by the candidate's instruction. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note meticulously extracts all musculoskeletal findings verbatim from the transcript, precisely following its instruction. The benchmark note incorrectly provides no information for this field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate note accurately summarizes all imaging findings, including the specific details for both the right and left hands, and correctly interprets the instruction regarding the calcific arteriogram deletion. Minor phrasing differences do not alter the factual content. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate note accurately identifies and lists the core medical conditions. It correctly includes 'with progression' for CMC arthritis as dictated, which the benchmark missed. It also correctly excludes the normal finding 'skin is intact' based on its primary instruction, demonstrating adherence despite a contradictory secondary instruction for that specific phrase. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | The candidate note accurately captures most aspects of the plan. It misses one minor detail regarding the patient's understanding that the procedure would be done today. Otherwise, the content and structure are excellent and align with the instructions. |

**Total Score:** 34/35

**Percentage:** 97.14%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates exceptional accuracy and adherence to specific instructions for almost all fields. It consistently extracted precise details from the transcript, often matching or even improving upon the benchmark's accuracy (e.g., MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM and ASSESSMENT_SPENCER). The few minor discrepancies were largely due to strict adherence to its own detailed instructions (HPI_SPENCER, ASSESSMENT_SPENCER) or very minor omissions (PLAN_SPENCER_). Overall, the note is of very high quality and clinically relevant.

| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | The candidate note correctly identified 'Cathy Smith' but incorrectly included two additional patient names (Brigitte Metman, Samar Actrion) which are not part of the single patient note defined by the benchmark. This indicates a failure to adhere to the implicit scope of a single-patient note. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 0 | The candidate note completely missed Cathy Smith's chief complaint of 'Follow up hand pain and swelling', instead listing chief complaints for other patients discussed in the transcript, which is entirely irrelevant to Cathy Smith's note. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate note provided HPI details for a different patient from the transcript (the first patient mentioned), completely missing the HPI for Cathy Smith, which was about her follow-up, general well-being, continued pain/swelling, and dissatisfaction with therapy. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The candidate note listed musculoskeletal findings for other patients discussed in the transcript, rather than providing the verbatim findings for Cathy Smith related to her incisions, swelling, and range of motion. This is completely irrelevant to the benchmark note. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The candidate note provided imaging results for other patients from the transcript, whereas the benchmark correctly noted no imaging results were discussed for Cathy Smith for this visit. All content is incorrect in the context of Cathy Smith's note. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate note provided assessment items for other patients in the transcript, completely missing Cathy Smith's relevant assessment of 'Hand swelling' and 'Hand pain'. All content is incorrect. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 0 | The candidate note provided plans for other patients from the transcript and failed to capture the specific details of Cathy Smith's plan, which included continuing therapy and transitioning care to Jack, beyond a generic follow-up time. All content is incorrect in context. |

**Total Score:** 1/35

**Percentage:** 2.857142857142857%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed extremely poorly due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the task's scope. While the transcript contained information for multiple patients, the benchmark note clearly indicated the output should be for 'Cathy Smith' only. The candidate note erroneously attempted to extract details for all patients across nearly all fields (Chief Complaint, HPI, Musculoskeletal, Imaging, Assessment, Plan), resulting in content that was irrelevant or incorrect for Cathy Smith. The only partial correctness was identifying 'Cathy Smith' as a patient, but this was marred by the inclusion of other patient names. This indicates a severe deficiency in identifying the target patient and filtering relevant information within a multi-patient clinical conversation.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient name 'Nadeem Nemi' is perfectly captured and adheres to the instruction of only returning the patient's name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The chief complaint 'Bilateral thumb pain' is accurately identified and adheres to the instruction to provide only the chief complaint without additional details. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | While the candidate note correctly extracts the onset, duration, location, and severity, it misses a minor but relevant detail from the transcript and benchmark: 'He is not having any numbness and tingling'. The format is also significantly different from the narrative style of the benchmark, adhering to its own specific instruction for structured output. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note accurately captures the musculoskeletal findings verbatim from the transcript, including 'Bilateral upper extremity skin is clean, dry, and intact', which is more accurate to the transcript than the benchmark's 'Right upper extremity Skin'. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | The candidate note misses several key details from the imaging results, including 'of the right hand, three views', 'Calcific arteriogram is noted', and 'Left hand x-ray findings are the same as the right hand, except no calcific arteriogram.' These are significant omissions. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note only lists 'Bilateral thumb CMC arthritis (progressed)' and misses two other active conditions mentioned in the transcript and benchmark: 'Right cubital tunnel syndrome' and 'Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome'. The instruction to not include 'skin is intact' and then to include it if found is contradictory, but even following the primary instruction (only active conditions), these were missed. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate note misses one specific recommendation: 'Consider nerve studies if symptoms re-emerge.' This is a minor but notable omission in the plan. |

**Total Score:** 25/35

**Percentage:** 71.43%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed well in accurately extracting the patient's name and chief complaint, and exceptionally well in the verbatim musculoskeletal section, even correcting a discrepancy found in the benchmark. However, it struggled with comprehensive detail extraction for longer and more complex fields like HPI, Imaging Results, and Assessment, leading to multiple missing details. The adherence to its own internal instructions sometimes resulted in format differences from the benchmark (HPI) or significant content omissions (Assessment). The plan also missed a minor detail.

| Title | Score (0-5)| Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Perfect match in factual content and adherence to instructions. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The candidate added 'Recurrence of' which is a detail more suited for the HPI, whereas the chief complaint itself, as per the benchmark, is the 'Left middle finger trigger finger'. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate completely failed to extract any HPI information from the transcript, despite relevant details regarding past injection, recurrence, and follow-up being present in the conversation. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Both the candidate and benchmark notes correctly indicate that no verbatim musculoskeletal exam findings were dictated, which aligns with the doctor's instruction to 'keep the exam the same' without dictating new findings. The empty list is an acceptable representation. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both notes correctly indicate that no imaging results were to be included, aligning with the doctor's statement to 'remove the imaging review for the plan'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Similar to the Chief Complaint, the candidate included 'recurrence' in the assessment. While factually correct, the assessment typically focuses on the core diagnosis ('Trigger finger of the left middle finger') rather than historical context, making the benchmark more concise and accurate for this field. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate accurately captured all plan details, including the fact that the injection was performed today and the follow-up instructions. The use of a list also aligns with the candidate's own instructions for this field. |

**Total Score:** 26/35

**Percentage:** 74.28571428571429%

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in accurately identifying the patient's name, and correctly noting the absence of dictated musculoskeletal exam findings and imaging results. It also excelled in extracting and formatting the plan details. However, it critically failed in generating the History of Present Illness (HPI), omitting all relevant information. Furthermore, for the Chief Complaint and Assessment fields, the candidate included descriptive details like 'recurrence' which, while factual, are generally considered HPI content rather than the concise chief complaint or the direct medical diagnosis, leading to minor inaccuracies in those fields compared to the benchmark.
