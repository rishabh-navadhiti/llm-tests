  "field_scores": {
    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark note explicitly contains the patient name 'Linda Omansky'. The candidate note returns only '-', indicating a complete failure to extract or include the patient's name as present in the ground truth."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note perfectly matches the chief complaint 'Numbness and tingling in the right hand' found in the benchmark and accurately extracted from the transcript."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate note's HPI format (Onset, Duration, Location, Severity) and content are vastly different from the benchmark's comprehensive narrative HPI. While some extracted points are accurate, it misses significant details such as the reevaluation purpose, the burned thumb, difficulty with earrings, and trying to hold the phone less, which are all present in the benchmark."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate missed specific details like 'A1 pulley' for the tenderness. Crucially, it incorrectly included 'X-ray is clear' within the musculoskeletal findings, which is an imaging result and not a physical exam finding, violating the field's intended content."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate note states 'X-ray is clear.' based on the transcript. However, the benchmark note, considered the ground truth, explicitly states 'XR - Deferred.', indicating a significant factual difference. The benchmark's history shows this was a human correction from 'X-ray is clear'."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate provides a list of symptoms/conditions ('Right hand numbness and tingling', 'Right thumb burn injury', 'Right small finger trigger nodule') which are factually relevant but do not match the benchmark's concise and single diagnosis of 'Trigger finger.'. The benchmark demonstrates a higher level of clinical abstraction that the candidate did not replicate."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The candidate captured the core plan points (injection, splints, nerve studies, follow-up). However, it lacked the conversational context and specific details present in the benchmark regarding the trigger finger injection (e.g., last injection date, patient's desire, doctor's agreement). The overall flow is less conversational than the benchmark's plan."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 14,
  "percentage": 40.0,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in accurately extracting the Chief Complaint. However, its overall performance was significantly hampered by deviations from the benchmark's content, format, and level of detail across most other fields. Key issues include missing crucial information (e.g., patient name, HPI narrative details), including irrelevant information in fields (e.g., X-ray in Musculoskeletal), and failing to match the precise and often more clinically abstracted content of the benchmark (e.g., Imaging, Assessment, Plan context). The candidate frequently adhered to its internal instructions, but these instructions did not always align with the benchmark's established ground truth, leading to lower scores."
