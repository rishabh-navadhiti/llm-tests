    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Both the candidate note and the benchmark note correctly indicate that the patient's name was not specified in the transcript for the primary patient being documented."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate's chief complaint 'Evaluation of left small finger' is too general. The transcript clearly states the specific reason for evaluation: 'He states that he first noticed locking and catching about two years ago.' The benchmark accurately captures 'Left small finger locking and catching', which is the actual chief complaint."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate strictly adhered to its specific instruction to only provide 'Onset, duration, location and severity' for the HPI. All details provided (Onset: Two years ago, Location: Left small finger, Severity: Not specified) are factually correct based on the transcript. 'Duration: Ongoing' is a reasonable inference. The candidate perfectly followed its given constraints for this field."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate perfectly adhered to the instruction 'Must be extract what doctor has dictated, Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.' It included filler words ('In fact,', 'Um,') and the exact phrasing 'aim of fluid is nodule that is triggering' as spoken by the doctor. While the benchmark presented a clinically refined version, the candidate successfully met the specific verbatim requirement."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate correctly states 'X-rays are normal for the finger'. However, the benchmark 'X-rays of the left small finger are normal' is more specific by identifying 'left small finger'. This is a minor omission of detail, but the core meaning is preserved."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Both the candidate ('Left small finger trigger finger') and the benchmark ('Trigger finger (left small finger)') accurately and concisely state the patient's assessment. The meaning is identical."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate's plan, 'Proceed with trigger finger release surgery on the left small finger,' accurately reflects the plan for the first patient ('finger plan will be, uh, planned trigger'). The benchmark incorrectly includes 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks,' which was a follow-up instruction for a *different* patient later in the transcript. The candidate correctly avoided this misattribution, demonstrating higher factual accuracy for the intended patient, despite its own instruction asking for follow-up (which wasn't present for this specific patient)."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 31,
  "percentage": 88.57,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note performed strongly, especially in adhering to specific field instructions for HPI and Musculoskeletal verbatim extraction. It accurately identified the patient's name, assessment, and the primary plan of action, notably avoiding a misattributed follow-up instruction present in the benchmark. The main area for improvement was the 'Chief Complaint,' which was too generic, and a minor lack of specificity in the 'Imaging Results' field."
