    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark note includes 'Sandra Herrara' as the patient name, which is considered the ground truth. The candidate note returns '-', indicating no patient name was identified. This is a complete factual miss compared to the benchmark, even if the name was not explicitly stated in the provided transcript snippet."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The benchmark's 'Follow up for hand pain' is a more appropriate and general chief complaint. The candidate's 'Injection did not offer any relief' is too specific and functions more as an HPI detail or a reason for the visit rather than the overarching chief complaint. It misses the broader context of the patient's complaint."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark correctly extracts key HPI information: 'She reports previous injection did not offer any relief. She wants to know what is going on.' The candidate note returns '-', indicating a complete failure to capture relevant HPI content that was present in the transcript and deemed necessary by the benchmark (ground truth). While the candidate's internal instructions were very specific, the benchmark still serves as the ground truth for content inclusion."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate note missed a significant detail from the transcript: 'Mild over the first dorsal compartment,' which the benchmark accurately interpreted as 'Mild tenderness to palpation over the first dorsal compartment.' Additionally, the candidate incorrectly combined 'Positive finger stain and grind' and did not interpret 'finger stain' as 'Finkelstein,' which the benchmark correctly did. While the candidate's instruction was 'verbatim,' it was not perfectly verbatim ('CMC during' vs 'CMC joint') and more importantly, missed substantial clinical information present in the transcript compared to the benchmark."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "No imaging results were mentioned in the transcript. Both the benchmark and candidate notes correctly reflect this by returning '-'."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The benchmark provides a concise and accurate assessment of the patient's underlying condition: 'Pain in hand.' The candidate's response, 'Injection did not offer any relief,' describes a historical event or treatment outcome rather than the current medical condition itself, which is more appropriate for the HPI section. It does not align with the instruction to list 'current medical conditions.'"
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate note misses the contextual statement 'Her previous injection offered no relief,' which the benchmark correctly includes as part of the plan's rationale. The candidate also transcribes 'dig verban's injection' verbatim instead of correcting it to 'de Quervain's injection,' which the benchmark accurately provides as the clinically correct term. Additionally, the candidate used 'six' instead of the numerical '6' for the follow-up time, which is a minor formatting deviation from its own instruction 'User numbers instead of word where necessary'."
    }

  "total_score": 12,
  "percentage": 34.285714285714285,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note performed poorly, demonstrating significant inaccuracies and omissions compared to the benchmark. It failed to identify crucial information such as the patient's name and HPI details present in the ground truth. Its interpretations for Chief Complaint and Assessment were more aligned with HPI, indicating a misunderstanding of these distinct clinical sections. The Musculoskeletal section was incomplete and lacked clinical refinement found in the benchmark. Furthermore, the Plan section omitted important contextual information and failed to correct a common medical mispronunciation, highlighting a weakness in clinical accuracy and adherence to a comprehensive scribe-style output."
