    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark note includes 'Susan Oakes' for the patient's name. The candidate note left this field empty, despite the benchmark containing this information."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The candidate note listed specific symptoms ('Achiness in wrist, limited motion, and electric sensations in hand') as the chief complaint. While these are accurate symptoms, the benchmark note more precisely identifies the chief complaint as a 'Follow-up for wrist achiness and limited motion,' reflecting the nature of the visit as a follow-up for pre-existing issues. The candidate missed the 'follow-up' aspect, which is a key part of the chief complaint."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The candidate adhered to its specific instruction to focus on onset, duration, location, and severity, providing a structured HPI. It correctly identified stable symptoms, location (wrist and hand), and severity (achiness and electric sensations). However, it missed broader narrative details present in the benchmark HPI (which is a more direct transcription), such as the patient's general well-being and her direct question about the nerve study results. It also implied 'since last visit' which wasn't explicitly stated, though 'stable' was."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate accurately extracted the verbatim phrase 'Her exam is unchanged' from the transcript, perfectly adhering to the instruction to provide verbatim physical examination findings. The benchmark having '-' is a discrepancy with the transcript, making the candidate's output superior in adherence to the provided audio."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate incorrectly stated 'Nerve study results pending'. The transcript clearly indicates that the doctor reviewed the nerve studies and discussed specific findings ('no evidence of carpal tunnel', 'evidence of ulnar nerve compression'), meaning the results are not pending but have been reviewed. The benchmark correctly lists 'Nerve study results' without implying pendency."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate accurately listed the active medical conditions/symptoms based on the transcript: 'Wrist achiness and limited motion', 'Electric sensations in hand', 'Possible ulnar nerve compression', and 'Cervical radiculopathy'. It correctly excluded normal exam findings as per its instructions. This aligns well with the expected content for this section, which was partially derived from the benchmark's `history.data` for this initially blank field."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate's plan is significantly abbreviated compared to the benchmark and the comprehensive details mentioned in the transcript. It missed several key components such as the context ('Regarding the wrist', 'Regarding the cervical radiculopathy'), details about the patient's progress ('She is doing well', 'She is continuing to gain strength'), the instruction to 'delete the carpal tunnel,' and specific findings from the nerve studies relevant to the plan ('no evidence of carpal tunnel', 'evidence of ulnar nerve compression... but she is not symptomatic in that distribution, we will watch this for now'). Additionally, it transcribed 'Urology consult' verbatim, which is a likely clinical misstatement for 'neurology consult' given the context of radiculopathy, and the benchmark corrected this for clinical accuracy."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 19,
  "percentage": 54.28,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated strength in accurately extracting verbatim information when specifically instructed, as seen in the Musculoskeletal section. It also performed well in generating a concise assessment based on active symptoms. However, its performance was significantly hampered by missing crucial details in the HPI and Plan sections, leading to an incomplete clinical picture. A major factual inaccuracy was noted in the Imaging Results (incorrectly stating 'pending') and a clinically questionable verbatim transcription in the Plan ('Urology consult' instead of 'Neurology consult' for radiculopathy), which the benchmark corrected. The complete omission of patient name, though not present in the transcript, was a direct mismatch with the benchmark, impacting the overall score."
