    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 5,

    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note accurately identified 'Left wrist pain' as the chief complaint, matching the benchmark and adhering to the instruction for conciseness."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "While the candidate note adhered to its internal instruction to only list onset, duration, location, and severity, it significantly missed extensive factual content present in the benchmark HPI, including patient demographics, prior treatments, diagnoses, and previous consultations/imaging. This constitutes multiple missing details compared to the comprehensive benchmark."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark note explicitly states '-' for this field, indicating no content is expected. The candidate note, however, provided a detailed list of musculoskeletal findings, which, although mostly accurate from the transcript, is a complete mismatch with the benchmark's content for this field. Therefore, it is considered completely incorrect in the context of matching the benchmark."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate note accurately captured the primary imaging findings. There was a minor difference in the specificity of the retinacular cyst location ('in the wrist' vs. 'superficial to the first dorsal compartment sheath' in the benchmark), but the overall meaning of the findings was preserved."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate note missed 'Bilateral thumb and MCP joint masses,' which was a stated diagnosis in the transcript and present in the benchmark. Additionally, it omitted normal exam findings ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.') which were present in the benchmark, despite conflicting instructions within the candidate note itself. 'Left wrist pain' is a symptom rather than a diagnosis in this context. These are multiple missing details."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate note correctly identified night splints, observation for masses, and follow-up time. However, it entirely missed a crucial part of the plan: 'Aspiration versus biopsy of the wrist mass.' This is a major content difference and omission from the benchmark."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 20,
  "percentage": 57.14,
  "overall_summary": "The AI-generated note demonstrated strong performance in extracting basic patient information like name and chief complaint. However, its overall quality was significantly hampered by major omissions and discrepancies in more complex sections such as the History of Present Illness, Assessment, and Plan. A notable issue arose with the Musculoskeletal field, where the candidate note provided content while the benchmark indicated an empty field, leading to a complete mismatch. The candidate's adherence to its internal, sometimes overly restrictive, instructions often resulted in an incomplete note when compared to the comprehensive golden standard, highlighting a need for improved alignment between internal model instructions and desired output completeness."
