  "overall_summary": "The candidate note performed well in identifying the chief complaint and correctly noting the absence of relevant imaging results. However, it significantly struggled with the HPI, Musculoskeletal exam findings (hallucinating/misclassifying information), Assessment, and Plan fields. There were critical omissions in the Assessment and Plan, and the HPI was completely missed. The inclusion of 'Mr.' in the patient name was a minor deviation from the strict benchmark. Overall, the note suffers from significant factual incompleteness and misinterpretation of field instructions."
