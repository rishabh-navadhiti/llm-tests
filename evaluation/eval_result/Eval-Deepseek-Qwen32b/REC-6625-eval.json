      "justification": "Perfect match in factual content and adherence to instructions. The patient's name 'Parviz Mikael' was correctly extracted."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The candidate included 'seeking update on condition' in addition to 'No pain'. The instruction was to provide 'only the patient's chief complaint without any additional details or context', which the benchmark 'No pain' correctly adhered to."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The candidate completely failed to extract any relevant HPI information from the transcript ('he states that he has no pain. He wants to know, uh, what is going on.') and returned the default placeholder '-'. The benchmark correctly captured this information."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate's output is largely verbatim, matching the benchmark closely. A minor difference is the use of 'and' to combine 'parthenonic carpal stable alignment' and 'stiff fingers' into a single phrase, whereas the benchmark and transcript treated 'stiff fingers' as a slightly separate observation. This is a minor wording difference but slightly deviates from strict verbatim adherence."

    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Perfect match in factual content and adherence to instructions. The imaging result 'X-rays are the same as the last time' was correctly extracted."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate's output ('Stiff fingers', 'Parthenonic carpal stable alignment') significantly differs from the benchmark's ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.'). Despite the candidate's instruction being contradictory, the benchmark's content aligns with the specific latter rules given to the candidate ('If skin is intact say 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.'. - If no tendon palpation. say ' No tenderness to palpation. '). The candidate failed to follow these specific templated instructions and instead included exam findings which contradict other general rules in its own instructions ('Do not include any exam findings')."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate comprehensively captured all key elements of the plan, often providing more detail and accuracy for the follow-up instructions than the benchmark. It correctly parsed the 'plexal ligament split' options and included precise details for the 10-day follow-up including pin removal/repeat X-rays and splint transition. The 'Consult with Eliza Cherian' is also a suitable interpretation of 'we're gonna go see Eliza Cherian'."

  "total_score": 23,
  "percentage": 65.71428571428571,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in extracting straightforward information such as patient name, imaging results, and a highly detailed plan, often surpassing the benchmark's completeness in the latter. However, it exhibited significant weaknesses in the HPI, completely omitting relevant information, and in the Chief Complaint by including extraneous details. The Assessment section was particularly problematic due to conflicting internal instructions and a failure to align with the specific templated phrases present in the benchmark, resulting in a low score for that field. The Musculoskeletal section was accurate but had a minor deviation from strict verbatim transcription."
