    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark note includes the patient's name, 'Eliza Asherian', which is considered the ground truth. The candidate note returned '-' for this field, failing to provide the correct patient name from the benchmark."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note 'Bilateral hand numbness, tingling, and burning pain.' perfectly matches the content and intent of the benchmark note 'Bilateral hand numbness and tingling, and burning pain' and accurately reflects the chief complaint from the transcript."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "While the candidate note followed its own instruction to only provide Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity, it significantly missed clinically relevant details present in the benchmark note and transcript. Key omissions include the patient's profession/location, the referral from OB, the context of previous pregnancy symptoms beyond intensity, and the diagnosis of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome which is often included in HPI for context. The HPI in the candidate note is far less comprehensive than the benchmark."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate note accurately extracted the key musculoskeletal findings verbatim from the transcript ('Bilateral upper extremity skin is clean, dry, and intact without erythema or ecchymosis. Decreased sensation to the middle fingers noted.'). It omitted the ambiguous '.PCTS' present in the benchmark, which was not clearly dictated. Minor formatting differences compared to the benchmark (e.g., combining sentences rather than separate lines), but meaning is preserved and largely verbatim."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note 'X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy.' is a perfect, verbatim match to the benchmark note and the transcript."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note 'Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.' perfectly matches the benchmark note and accurately reflects the diagnosis mentioned in the transcript."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The candidate note missed several important details in the plan. It omitted the information about the patient already wearing splints without enough improvement to sleep through the night, which the benchmark included. Additionally, while it mentioned discussing risks and temporary nature, it missed the explicit statement that injections 'will do them today' and 'she understands' which were present in the benchmark and transcript."

  "total_score": 24,
  "percentage": 68.57142857142857,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in fields requiring direct and concise extraction, such as Chief Complaint, Imaging Results, and Assessment. The Musculoskeletal verbatim section was also well-handled, capturing essential details accurately. However, the note suffered significantly due to a complete omission of the patient's name (which was in the benchmark) and a notably sparse History of Present Illness (HPI) section, where the model's strict instructions led to the exclusion of important contextual and narrative details present in the benchmark. The Plan section also missed key information regarding prior treatment and specific details about the planned injections. This highlights a need for more robust instruction following or better instruction design for complex clinical sections where comprehensive detail is expected."
