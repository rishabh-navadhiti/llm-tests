    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The candidate failed to extract the patient's name, which is provided in the benchmark as the ground truth. This is a major content difference."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate added 'following laceration' which is additional context not present in the concise benchmark chief complaint. Meaning is preserved, but there's a minor difference in conciseness."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate strictly followed its own instruction to only provide onset, duration, location, and severity. However, this results in a highly condensed HPI that lacks the comprehensive narrative and details present in the benchmark, leading to a major content difference from the golden standard HPI."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate's output for this field is highly accurate and adheres closely to the verbatim instruction provided to it. Minor differences from the benchmark (e.g., 'PIP' vs 'proximal interphalangeal joint', 'Stiff' vs 'Very stiff', missing 'at this time') are negligible. For 'No sensory tenderness to palpation' and 'remaining digit', the candidate is more verbatim to the transcript than the benchmark, aligning perfectly with its own instructions."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate's 'Normal X-rays' preserves the meaning of the benchmark's 'X-rays are normal.' with only minor wording differences."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate combined 'stiff index finger PIP joint with limited motion and swelling' into a single item. Crucially, it omitted 'Laceration of the left index finger' as a distinct assessment, which is present and relevant in the benchmark. This represents a missing key detail."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The candidate missed the initial 'Plan proximal interphalangeal' phrase present in the benchmark (which itself is a slightly expanded version of the doctor's 'Plan PIP'). For the follow-up, the candidate's 'follow-up evaluation' is less specific than the benchmark's 'followup with range of motion check'. This indicates partial adherence and some missing details."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 19,
  "percentage": 54.28571428571429,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated strength in fields requiring verbatim extraction, particularly the Musculoskeletal Exam, where it closely followed its own instructions and matched the transcript well. However, its overall performance was significantly hampered by its inability to extract the patient's name and its overly restrictive internal instructions for the HPI field, which led to a major content mismatch compared to the comprehensive benchmark. Additionally, the Assessment field showed a notable omission, and the Plan field was less detailed than the benchmark. The key weakness lies in the discrepancy between adherence to internal, sometimes too narrow, instructions and producing a clinically complete note that aligns with a comprehensive golden standard."
