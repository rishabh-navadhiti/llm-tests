# REC-6602

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Benchmark lists a patient name not present in the transcript; candidate left the field unspecified (unknown). Per instructions, do not penalize for benchmark-only info not in transcript. No hallucinated name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Content matches benchmark meaning exactly: numbness and tingling in the right hand. Only minor casing/wording differences. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures all key elements (post-chemotherapy status, increased right-hand numbness/tingling, right thumb burn, difficulty with earrings, seeking evaluation). Minor deviations include adding 'recent' and implying difficulty holding a phone rather than 'trying to hold her phone less,' and omitting 'at home more.' Overall meaning preserved. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Includes the same findings as benchmark (skin intact, tenderness of right small finger, triggering, nodule, excellent ROM). Minor verbatim/terminology differences ('A one foley' vs 'A1 pulley'; 'pcgs are normal' vs '.PCTS') and formatting differences, but factual content aligns. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | Candidate states 'X-ray is clear,' whereas benchmark indicates 'XR - Deferred.' This is a major content discrepancy relative to the ground truth. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark assessment lists only 'Trigger finger.' Candidate adds multiple problems (right hand numbness/tingling, right thumb sensory deficit, carpal tunnel syndrome), which are not in the benchmark assessment. Major divergence. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark plan: trigger finger injection requested (last in 2015), reasonable to proceed; carpal tunnel plan with night splints; low threshold for nerve studies; return in 2 months. Only minor wording differences. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** Strong alignment on chief complaint and plan; musculoskeletal exam largely consistent with minor terminology differences. HPI is accurate with slight inferential wording. Major mismatches in imaging (candidate: clear vs benchmark: deferred) and assessment (candidate added problems vs benchmark lists only trigger finger) reduced the score.

# REC-6604

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | Benchmark lists 'Nicole Kaffee' while candidate has 'Nicole Coffee' from the transcript. The benchmark’s corrected spelling is not stated in the transcript, so only a minor penalty is applied. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Semantically identical to the benchmark: left index finger pain. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Captures duration (few months), worsening/not improved, relation to prior shoulder visit/observation, and request for injection. No extraneous details. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Includes the key findings (skin clean/dry, tenderness at A1 pulley, locking/catching, triggering, excellent ROM). Minor wording differences vs benchmark (e.g., 'tacky' vs 'intact', absence of 'no ecchymosis') but core content aligns. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Conveys normal multi-view finger X-rays consistent with the benchmark. Omits 'left index' and differs in phrasing, but meaning preserved; side detail was not explicit in the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Matches benchmark problems: left index finger pain and trigger finger. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Benchmark plan indicates proceeding with trigger injection today; candidate includes 'She is not having the injection' (contradictory) and adds imaging results within the plan. Multiple deviations from benchmark content. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.85714285714286

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for chief complaint, HPI, assessment, and generally for musculoskeletal exam and imaging. Main weaknesses are the patient name spelling (likely chart-corrected in the benchmark) and the plan, which contains a contradictory statement and includes imaging details. Overall, clinically accurate with minor wording issues and a significant discrepancy in the plan.

# REC-6605

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | No patient name is stated in the transcript; candidate correctly returned '-'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Matches benchmark content ('left small finger locking and catching'); only capitalization differs. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Accurately captures onset (~2 years), location (left small finger), delay due to prior surgeries, and desire for treatment. Benchmark mentions job impact not clearly stated in transcript; no penalty. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Includes all key findings consistent with benchmark: skin noted, no erythema, moderate TTP at A1 pulley (as transcribed), palpable nodule, excellent ROM, well-healed prior incisions. Verbatim style preserved. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Conveys the same result as benchmark: X-rays are normal. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Correctly identifies 'left small finger trigger finger,' matching the benchmark diagnosis. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | Transcript indicates a planned trigger finger release; candidate left the plan as '-' and omitted this. Not penalizing for the benchmark’s 2-week follow-up, which is not clearly stated in the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 31

**Percentage:** 88.57

**Overall Summary:** Strong alignment with the benchmark for chief complaint, HPI, exam, imaging, and assessment. The primary deficiency is the omission of the documented plan (planned trigger finger release).

# REC-6607

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Benchmark lists a specific name, but the transcript does not state the patient's name. The candidate correctly returned '-' per instructions; no penalty for benchmark-only info not present in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | The benchmark chief complaint is 'Wrist pain,' which is explicitly stated in the transcript. The candidate left this field as '-', representing a major omission. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures all key elements from the transcript: improved synovitis after injection, infusion for osteoporosis, prior knee replacement with sufficient recovery, interest in right total wrist arthroplasty, limitation due to wrist pain, and visit purpose. Minor issue: specifies 'right' wrist pain, whereas laterality of pain was not stated. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark leaves this blank; the transcript does not provide a specific musculoskeletal exam finding. The candidate inserted 'Exam mostly unchanged, except you can delete the large, poorly defined nodule,' which is not a musculoskeletal finding and mixes imaging directives. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | Transcript indicates imaging status: 'The imaging you can leave all the same' and to remove a 'large, poorly defined nodule'; benchmark summarizes as 'Imaging mostly unchanged.' The candidate returned '-', omitting explicit imaging findings. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes key items from the benchmark—'bilateral wrist arthritis' and 'synovitis.' However, it adds 'right wrist pain' (laterality not specified in transcript), 'knee replacement' (not an active problem), and 'osteoporosis' (not in the benchmark assessment), introducing extra/minor inaccuracies. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Accurately reflects the dictated plan: exam mostly unchanged; imaging unchanged; patient interested in right total wrist arthroplasty; synovitis down; knee recovery sufficient to start planning. Differences such as 'We will proceed' in the benchmark are not penalized since they are not present in the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 20

**Percentage:** 57.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the HPI and plan well, aligning closely with the dictated content. Major shortcomings include missing the clear chief complaint, misplacing non-MSK content in the Musculoskeletal section, and failing to document imaging findings. Assessment includes core items but adds less appropriate/incorrectly specified entries.

# REC-6608

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The transcript does not mention a patient name; the candidate correctly returned '-'. The benchmark includes a name not present in the transcript, which should not be penalized per instructions. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | No chief complaint is explicitly stated in the transcript; the candidate appropriately returned '-'. The benchmark’s entry should not be used to penalize absent transcript data. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Accurately summarizes that a prior injection provided no relief and the patient seeks to understand the issue, matching the benchmark’s factual content. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Captures all dictated findings verbatim: hypopigmentation at dorsal CMC consistent with prior injection, mild over first dorsal compartment, positive Finkelstein (as dictated 'finger stain'), and positive grind. Differences are minor wording/normalization only. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging results are mentioned in the transcript; both candidate and benchmark appropriately show '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The transcript does not explicitly state an assessment; the candidate returned '-'. The benchmark’s 'Pain in hand' should not be used to penalize since it is not in the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches the dictated plan: prior injection offered no relief, recommend trial of de Quervain’s injection, and return in six weeks. Minor dictation artifacts preserved, but factual content aligns with the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 35

**Percentage:** 100

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely adheres to the transcript, avoids hallucinations, and captures key elements accurately. Differences from the benchmark are limited to normalization and inclusion of items not present in the transcript, which were appropriately omitted.

# REC-6610

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark patient name ('Stephanie Humphrey'). |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Matches benchmark ('Left wrist pain'); minor casing difference only. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures mechanism, date, laterality, urgent care X-rays with no fracture, sprain diagnosis, and humidity-related exacerbation leading to evaluation. Minor omissions versus benchmark (location 'leaving Groundlings' and trip to 'Massachusetts'). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark lists no content ('-'), whereas candidate includes detailed exam text. Although clinically relevant and transcript-supported, it diverges from the ground-truth content for this field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Conveys both urgent care X-rays showing no fracture and current left wrist X-rays being normal, consistent with benchmark. Minor wording/context differences (e.g., not explicitly labeling 'urgent care' and 'current' in the first line). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Includes both key problems ('Left ECU tendonitis' and 'Left ulnar-sided wrist pain') exactly as in the benchmark. Benchmark also lists normal/negative findings not stated in the transcript; not penalized. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Includes all benchmark plan elements (hand therapy, MRI, return after MRI). Adds an extra diagnostic naming line and omits the unclear 'RE full' from the transcript; minor deviation from benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 28

**Percentage:** 80.0

**Overall Summary:** Strong alignment on patient identification, chief complaint, HPI core details, imaging findings, assessment, and most of the plan. Primary discrepancy is inclusion of musculoskeletal exam text where the benchmark had none, and minor omissions of contextual details in the HPI and plan.

# REC-6612

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Benchmark lists a name, but the transcript contains no patient name. The candidate correctly returned '-' per instruction; not penalized for benchmark-only information. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Captures wrist achiness and limited motion; adds electric sensations and omits 'follow-up'. Meaning largely preserved with minor differences. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Accurately includes stable wrist achiness/limited motion, electric sensations, and recent nerve studies inquiry. Misses 'life is difficult' and follow-up context; inappropriately adds 'exam is unchanged' (exam detail) not in benchmark HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Verbatim extraction 'Her exam is unchanged.' from transcript; benchmark left this blank, but transcript supports it. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | Benchmark notes 'Nerve study results' and transcript includes explicit results (no carpal tunnel; possible ulnar compression). Candidate returned '-', missing available imaging/electrodiagnostic content. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Lists active problems consistent with transcript (wrist achiness/limited motion, paresthesias) and adds relevant diagnoses (possible ulnar compression, cervical radiculopathy). Minor divergence from benchmark's items but clinically aligned. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Matches most plan elements (advance activity, delete carpal tunnel, watch ulnar compression, RTC 6 weeks, full duty date). However, uses 'urology consult' instead of benchmark-corrected 'neurology consult' and 'advanced laboring' vs 'advanced weightbearing'. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note generally captures the key symptoms and much of the plan accurately, with strong verbatim extraction for the musculoskeletal exam. Main shortcomings include omitting imaging/nerve study results, minor omissions/additions in the HPI, and a significant error in the specialty referral (urology vs neurology) within the plan.

# REC-6613

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'Precious Myles Garrett'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Includes 'left wrist pain' but omits 'and masses' present in the benchmark chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Captures all benchmark HPI facts (pain at night, two masses with locations, prior fluctuation now constant, rheumatology visit with X-ray and ultrasound) and adds only transcript-supported details (right-hand dominance, occupation). No extraneous findings. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Candidate provides a detailed verbatim exam from the transcript, whereas the benchmark field is blank. Although accurate to the transcript, it does not match the benchmark content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Fully consistent with benchmark: X-ray osteophyte at thumb MCP; ultrasound shows bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte at dorsal MCP; wrist ultrasound shows retinacular cyst superficial to first dorsal compartment. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes left wrist pain, first dorsal compartment cyst, and left thumb MCP osteophyte, aligning with benchmark problems. Omits 'bilateral hand pain' and normal findings that appear in the benchmark; the transcript does not clearly support 'bilateral hand pain,' so no penalty for that omission. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Contains night splints, observation, aspiration/biopsy consideration, and 6-week follow-up matching the benchmark. Adds 'plan carpal tunnel' from the transcript, which the benchmark excluded; otherwise aligned. |

**Total Score:** 28

**Percentage:** 80

**Overall Summary:** Strong performance with exact patient name, accurate HPI, and precise imaging results. Chief complaint missed the masses component, assessment largely aligns but lacks a benchmark-only item, and plan includes an extra transcript-supported element not in the benchmark. Musculoskeletal section accurately transcribed but diverges from the benchmark’s blank field.

# REC-6614

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to the benchmark name as stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Content matches 'Left wrist pain'; only capitalization differs, which is inconsequential. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Fully aligns with the benchmark HPI: right-hand dominance, occupation, left wrist pain worse than masses waking her at night, prior care by Dr. Ishimori, diagnoses listed, masses previously fluctuated now constant, and rheumatology imaging. No extra or missing elements. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark shows no content ('-'), whereas the candidate provides a full exam excerpt. Although the content reflects the transcript, it does not match the benchmark’s empty field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | All imaging findings match the benchmark: osteophyte at thumb MCP on X-ray, ultrasound showing bony avulsion fragment versus osteophyte at dorsal thumb MCP, and wrist ultrasound showing a retinacular cyst superficial to the first dorsal compartment sheath. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Includes some correct problems (left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte) but omits 'bilateral thumb and MCP joint masses' present in the benchmark and adds items not in the benchmark (retinacular cyst and definitive 'bony avulsion fragment'). Also adds 'left wrist pain,' which is not listed in the benchmark assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Includes night splints, observation, and 6-week follow-up, but misses 'aspiration versus biopsy of the wrist mass' from the benchmark and adds 'plan carpal tunnel,' which is not in the benchmark plan. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captures the patient name, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging findings. However, it diverges from the benchmark in the musculoskeletal (benchmark had no content), assessment (omits bilateral masses and adds non-benchmark items), and plan (omits aspiration/biopsy and adds carpal tunnel). Overall, strong on history and imaging but weaker alignment in assessment and plan.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'Kevin Clancy' is explicitly stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Candidate lists 'trigger finger' but omits laterality and digit ('left ring finger'), which are present in the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately includes 'left ring finger trigger finger' but adds plan details (injection), which are not part of HPI in the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | No musculoskeletal exam findings in transcript; candidate appropriately left it empty, consistent with benchmark's '-' (no data). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging results mentioned; candidate returns '-', matching the benchmark's absence of imaging. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Matches benchmark with both problems: 'Left ring finger trigger finger' and 'Plantar tendonitis.' |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Captures injection for trigger finger and home exercise program with low threshold for therapy, aligning with benchmark. Benchmark includes 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks' which is not in the transcript; not penalized. |

**Total Score:** 32

**Percentage:** 91.43

**Overall Summary:** Strong overall alignment with the benchmark. Strengths include accurate patient name, assessment, plan, and acknowledgment of no imaging or MSK findings. Minor weaknesses: chief complaint lacks laterality/digit detail, and HPI includes plan content.

# REC-6625

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark and transcript: 'Parviz Mikael'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Conveys the same meaning as benchmark ('No pain'); minor casing difference only. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Correctly includes follow-up and no pain/clarification request, but adds 'stiffness in his fingers,' which is an exam finding not included in the benchmark HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Captures all benchmark exam findings (clean pin sites, no significant tenderness with stable alignment, stiff fingers). Minor filler words/casing differences do not alter factual content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'X-rays are the same as the last time.' |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Benchmark lists 'Skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation.' Candidate lists 'stiff fingers' and omits 'no tenderness.' Not penalized for 'skin is intact' since that exact phrase is not in the transcript, but omission of 'no tenderness' and substitution with 'stiff fingers' results in mismatch. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Includes all core benchmark elements (continue splint, transition to phenylplastic splint, referral to Eliza Cherian, return in 10 days). Additional details ('likely pin removal or repeat X-rays') are present in the transcript and do not conflict with the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 30

**Percentage:** 85.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captured the patient name, chief complaint, imaging, musculoskeletal exam findings, and plan. The HPI included an exam-only detail (stiff fingers), and the Assessment deviated from the benchmark by omitting 'no tenderness' and adding 'stiff fingers.' Overall factual alignment is strong with minor sectioning/content placement issues.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Transcript does not state the patient's name; candidate correctly returned '-'. Benchmark includes a name not present in the transcript, which should not be penalized. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Semantic match to benchmark: bilateral hand numbness, tingling, and burning pain. Only minor capitalization differences. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Includes key elements matching the benchmark (onset ~July 1, 2025; similarity to prior pregnancy but earlier/more intense; OB referral for injections; splints with poor sleep). However, it adds non-HPI items (imaging deferral and plan to inject today), and omits job detail included in benchmark. Not penalized for right-hand dominance which is not in the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Accurately reflects verbatim exam from transcript: clean/dry/intact skin without erythema/ecchymosis; 'Got PCTS'; decreased sensation to middle fingers. Minor wording matches transcript. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Transcript explicitly states 'X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy,' which the benchmark captures. Candidate returned '-', missing this detail. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Exact diagnostic content match: bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Captures injections recommended, risks/temporary nature discussed, performing injections today, and follow-up in three months if symptoms persist postpartum. Misses the plan note about ongoing splint use and poor sleep included in the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 30

**Percentage:** 85.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark on chief complaint, assessment, and musculoskeletal exam, and mostly matches the plan. HPI covers key history but includes non-HPI items (imaging/plan) and omits employment detail. Imaging field missed the explicit 'X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy.' Overall, solid clinical alignment with a few sectioning and completeness issues.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'Greta Griswana'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Includes 'Thumb pain' but omits 'Forearm pain' present in the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Captures follow-up, improved forearm pain, severe thumb pain, and seeking relief. Missing the wedding/context and 'overall the same' details from the benchmark (not penalized if not clearly attributable in transcript), and adds an unstated functional limitation ('significantly limiting'), which is a minor hallucination. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Contains the same exam findings as the benchmark (right upper extremity findings, positive grind, A1 pulley non-tender, some tenderness at U&R eminence). Minor wording/filler differences and the 'termine' vs 'extremity' discrepancy, but factual content aligns. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Notes 'X-rays reviewed' but omits the benchmark’s finding that the X-rays show arthritis. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes the arthritis diagnosis (as 'Trapeziometacarpal joint arthritis') consistent with the benchmark’s 'Planned arthritis' and adds 'Thumb pain' which is accurate but extra. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark plan: trial steroid injection, counseling on temporary nature/procedure/post-op, and return in 8 weeks. Addition of 'if symptoms persist' is consistent with transcript and does not conflict. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14285714285714

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly identifies the patient and captures the core complaint and plan, closely aligning with the benchmark on exam findings and management. Main weaknesses are omission of the forearm component of the chief complaint, a pared-down imaging result lacking the arthritis finding, and an HPI that misses some contextual details while adding a minor unstated functional limitation.

# REC-6635

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Benchmark lists a name, but the transcript does not state the patient's name. Candidate correctly returned '-' per instructions; not penalized for benchmark-only info. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Content matches benchmark ('index finger pain and stiffness'); only case formatting differs. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately captures mechanism, date, urgent care treatment, suture removal and dehiscence, and current symptoms. Minor deviation by adding an exam detail (10 degrees active flexion) into HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Faithfully reflects the dictated exam: well-healing laceration without sutures, very stiff PIP with ~10° active flexion, moderate swelling, no tenderness to palpation, good ROM of remaining digit(s). Factual content aligns with benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'X-rays are normal.' |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes relevant problems but differs from benchmark: uses 'PIP laceration' without laterality and combines 'pain and stiffness' instead of 'stiff left index finger.' Partial mismatch of terms and specificity. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark plan elements: recommend hand therapy and return in 4 weeks; also reflects the dictated phrasing about PIP and follow-up. |

**Total Score:** 32

**Percentage:** 91.43

**Overall Summary:** Strong alignment with the benchmark across most sections. Chief complaint, musculoskeletal exam, imaging, and plan are accurately captured. Minor issue in HPI for including an exam detail, and the assessment lacks laterality and exact phrasing compared to the benchmark.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Content matches 'Follow-up'; only casing differs, which is a harmless formatting difference. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes correct reasons for splint removal and desire for guidance, but adds exam/objective details (laceration status, suture removal, pain severity, limited flexion) not appropriate for HPI and not present in the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Contains all benchmark exam statements and preserves meaning; includes extra transcript phrases ('On exam, um,' and 'Sutures removed today...') not in benchmark, making it close but not a perfect match. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Matches benchmark indicating no imaging results ('-'); consistent with transcript for this patient. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Candidate lists 'laceration, limited flexion, pain' whereas the benchmark assessment documents 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation.' Marked content mismatch. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Includes all benchmark plan items and adds extra plan details from the transcript ('It will be sutured in today,' 'range of motion check'). Overall aligned but not an exact match to the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly captured the patient name and chief complaint and closely reflected the plan and musculoskeletal exam, though it added some extra verbatim content. The HPI improperly included exam details and an unsupported pain severity, and the assessment diverged significantly from the benchmark. Overall, content accuracy was mixed with strengths in identification and plan elements but weaknesses in HPI discipline and assessment alignment.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to transcript: 'Kathy Smith' is explicitly stated. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | Benchmark lists 'Swelling and pain in hand' and 'Follow up for hand surgery'. Candidate gives 'Pain and deformity of the DIP joints,' which pertains to a different patient in the transcript and not this follow-up visit. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate mixes details from another patient (DIP deformity, trapeziometacarpal pain) and includes objective/imaging info contrary to instructions. It only partially aligns with the benchmark by noting dissatisfaction with therapy; it omits 'doing okay overall' and the follow-up context. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Not verbatim and conflates exams from different patients. Contains transcription errors ('A1 pony' vs 'A1 pulley', 'salvation' vs 'desquamation') and adds unrelated findings (DIP deformities, TMC tenderness) not in the benchmark for this patient. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | Benchmark indicates no imaging for this visit ('-'). Candidate includes X-ray findings from another patient, which is incorrect for this encounter. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate includes 'DIP joint arthritis' and 'Trapeziometacarpal arthritis' (from another patient) and misses 'Status post hand surgery'. Only overlaps with 'hand pain' and 'hand swelling'. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Includes correct elements 'continue therapy' and 'return to clinic in six weeks,' but adds unrelated plans (steroid injections, splints, DIP fusion) for a different patient and omits 'Return to Jack'. |

**Total Score:** 13

**Percentage:** 37.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly identifies the patient name but otherwise mixes content from multiple patients in the transcript. Chief complaint, HPI, exam, imaging, assessment, and plan include inappropriate details from another case and deviate from the benchmark. Only the therapy continuation and 6-week follow-up align; most other sections are inaccurate or non-verbatim.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to the transcript ('Nadeem Nemi'); fully aligns with the benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Matches 'Bilateral thumb pain' from the benchmark; case formatting difference only, meaning identical. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately captures worsening since 2019 (notably past 6 months), denial of numbness/tingling, significant pain/limitation, and relevant history. Minor inaccuracy by stating he 'received injections today' when the transcript indicates injections were planned for today. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Verbatim extraction of the dictated MSK exam (skin intact, no significant swelling, positive grind/shoulder sign, no triggering, 'dot NCTS'). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | Includes key right-hand findings (severe joint space changes with osteophytosis and Z deformity) but omits the right-hand 'calcific arteriogram' and all left-hand findings that were explicitly dictated. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Lists bilateral thumb pain, bilateral thumb CMC arthritis, and right cubital tunnel syndrome, but omits bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome which is explicitly stated in the transcript and included in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Accurately summarizes the plan: trial of injections with counseling on temporary effect and rebound pain to be done today; observe carpal/cubital tunnel with consideration of nerve studies; return in 2 months. Only minor wording differences. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark on patient name, chief complaint, MSK exam, and plan. HPI is largely accurate but slightly overstates that injections were already given. Imaging is under-documented, missing right-hand calcific arteriogram and all left-hand findings. Assessment omits bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Overall, clinically sound with a few notable omissions.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark ('Cathy Smith'); clearly stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | Benchmark: 'Follow up hand pain and swelling.' Candidate: 'Increasing pain and deformity of the DIP joints,' which reflects a different patient segment. Major mismatch in content despite related body region. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark HPI focuses on doing okay overall, persistent swelling/pain, dissatisfaction with therapy, and desire to return to Jack. Candidate HPI describes DIP and thumb CMC arthritis symptoms from another patient and includes an exam-like detail (right small-finger DIP flexion). Major content differences. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark includes post-op hand findings (incisions well healed, minimal scar, A1 pulley incision tenderness, full fist, moderate swelling, excellent ROM, pain with motion). Candidate includes that segment (with minor wording) but also adds unrelated DIP deformity and trapeziometacarpal joint findings from a different patient. Multiple extraneous details reduce accuracy. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | Benchmark: '-' (no imaging for this visit). Candidate provides detailed hand X-ray findings from another patient. Completely incorrect for the benchmarked patient. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark lists 'Hand swelling' and 'Hand pain.' Candidate lists DIP arthritis, thumb CMC arthritis, DIP flexion limitation, and scar tenderness—assessments from other patient segments and not the benchmark items. Major mismatch. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Benchmark plan: continue therapy, transition care with Jack, return in 6 weeks. Candidate includes 'continue therapy' and 'return to clinic in six weeks' but adds unrelated items (steroid injections, splints not needed, consider DIP fusion, 'activity is hard') and omits 'transition care with Jack.' Multiple incorrect additions with partial overlap. |

**Total Score:** 12

**Percentage:** 34.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate captured the correct patient name but otherwise mixed content from multiple patients in the transcript, leading to major mismatches in chief complaint, HPI, imaging, assessment, and plan. The musculoskeletal section partially matches but includes extraneous findings. Overall, the note shows poor alignment with the benchmarked patient’s visit.

# REC-6645

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | Benchmark lists 'Nadeem Nemi' (stated in transcript). Candidate returned '-', missing the explicitly mentioned patient name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Exact match in meaning to benchmark ('Bilateral thumb pain'); only casing differs. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Captures key details (bilateral thumb pain, worsening since 2019, worse in last 6 months, no numbness/tingling, functional limitation) but adds that injections were received today, which is not in the benchmark HPI and is not clearly confirmed; includes extra background details beyond benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Contains the benchmark’s core MSK findings (skin clean/dry/intact, positive grind, positive shoulder sign, no triggering). Minor differences include 'bilateral' vs 'right' and inclusion of extraneous imaging phrases. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | Includes severe joint space change, osteophytosis, Z deformity, and MCP hyperextension, but omits the benchmark detail of 'calcific arteriogram noted' on the right and the left-hand exception ('except no calcific arteriogram'), leading to multiple missing details. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Matches the benchmark diagnoses (bilateral thumb CMC arthritis, right cubital tunnel, bilateral carpal tunnel). Adds 'bilateral thumb pain' and omits the normal finding 'skin is intact' from the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Aligns with benchmark plan (trial of injections, counseling on temporary effect/rebound pain, observe carpal/cubital tunnel, consider nerve studies, 2-month follow-up). Adds non-clinical scheduling chatter ('talk next week'/'send a message Friday') and specifies 'today,' which the benchmark did not. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captured the chief complaint and most assessment and plan elements well. Major miss was the patient name and omission of key imaging detail (calcific arteriogram). HPI included extra and possibly premature treatment status. Musculoskeletal exam largely matched but included extraneous content. Overall, accurate core content with notable omissions and some unnecessary additions.

# REC-6682

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | The transcript explicitly states the patient's name as 'N. Kalinski,' but the candidate returned '-'. This is a major omission of explicit information. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | The chief complaint is clearly 'left middle finger trigger finger' per the transcript and benchmark, but the candidate left it as '-'. Major missing content. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately includes recurrence, prior injection date (10/22/24), and that an injection was performed today. It omits the stated detail that he will return to clinic if recurrence occurs, which appears in the benchmark, resulting in a minor omission. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | No musculoskeletal exam findings were dictated ('keep the exam the same'); benchmark shows none. The candidate appropriately left this empty. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging results were provided, and the doctor stated to remove imaging review. Candidate correctly returned '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Content matches the benchmark semantically: 'Left middle finger trigger finger.' |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches the benchmark plan: injection performed today and return to clinic if recurrence. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate accurately captured the assessment, plan, and most of the HPI with appropriate restraint and no hallucinations. However, it missed explicitly stated basics—patient name and chief complaint—and omitted a minor follow-up detail in the HPI. Otherwise, formatting and content fidelity were strong for the remaining fields.
