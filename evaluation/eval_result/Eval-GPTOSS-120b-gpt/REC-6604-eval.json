      "justification": "Includes the key findings (skin clean/dry, tenderness at A1 pulley, locking/catching, triggering, excellent ROM). Minor wording differences vs benchmark (e.g., 'tacky' vs 'intact', absence of 'no ecchymosis') but core content aligns."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for chief complaint, HPI, assessment, and generally for musculoskeletal exam and imaging. Main weaknesses are the patient name spelling (likely chart-corrected in the benchmark) and the plan, which contains a contradictory statement and includes imaging details. Overall, clinically accurate with minor wording issues and a significant discrepancy in the plan."
