      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Accurately summarizes that a prior injection provided no relief and the patient seeks to understand the issue, matching the benchmark’s factual content."

      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Captures all dictated findings verbatim: hypopigmentation at dorsal CMC consistent with prior injection, mild over first dorsal compartment, positive Finkelstein (as dictated 'finger stain'), and positive grind. Differences are minor wording/normalization only."

    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Matches the dictated plan: prior injection offered no relief, recommend trial of de Quervain’s injection, and return in six weeks. Minor dictation artifacts preserved, but factual content aligns with the benchmark."
