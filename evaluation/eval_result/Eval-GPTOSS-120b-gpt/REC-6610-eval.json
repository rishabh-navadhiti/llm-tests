      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Benchmark lists no content ('-'), whereas candidate includes detailed exam text. Although clinically relevant and transcript-supported, it diverges from the ground-truth content for this field."

      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Conveys both urgent care X-rays showing no fracture and current left wrist X-rays being normal, consistent with benchmark. Minor wording/context differences (e.g., not explicitly labeling 'urgent care' and 'current' in the first line)."

Primary discrepancy is inclusion of musculoskeletal exam text where the benchmark had none, and minor omissions of contextual details in the HPI and plan."
