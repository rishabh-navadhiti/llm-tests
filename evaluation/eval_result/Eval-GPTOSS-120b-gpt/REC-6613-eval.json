    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 3,

    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Captures all benchmark HPI facts (pain at night, two masses with locations, prior fluctuation now constant, rheumatology visit with X-ray and ultrasound) and adds only transcript-supported details (right-hand dominance, occupation). No extraneous findings."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Candidate provides a detailed verbatim exam from the transcript, whereas the benchmark field is blank. Although accurate to the transcript, it does not match the benchmark content."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Fully consistent with benchmark: X-ray osteophyte at thumb MCP; ultrasound shows bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte at dorsal MCP; wrist ultrasound shows retinacular cyst superficial to first dorsal compartment."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Includes left wrist pain, first dorsal compartment cyst, and left thumb MCP osteophyte, aligning with benchmark problems. Omits 'bilateral hand pain' and normal findings that appear in the benchmark; the transcript does not clearly support 'bilateral hand pain,' so no penalty for that omission."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Contains night splints, observation, aspiration/biopsy consideration, and 6-week follow-up matching the benchmark. Adds 'plan carpal tunnel' from the transcript, which the benchmark excluded; otherwise aligned."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 28,
  "percentage": 80,
  "overall_summary": "Strong performance with exact patient name, accurate HPI, and precise imaging results. Chief complaint missed the masses component, assessment largely aligns but lacks a benchmark-only item, and plan includes an extra transcript-supported element not in the benchmark. Musculoskeletal section accurately transcribed but diverges from the benchmarkâ€™s blank field."
