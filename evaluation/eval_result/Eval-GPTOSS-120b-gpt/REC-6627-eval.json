      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Transcript does not state the patient's name; candidate correctly returned '-'. Benchmark includes a name not present in the transcript, which should not be penalized."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Semantic match to benchmark: bilateral hand numbness, tingling, and burning pain. Only minor capitalization differences."

    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Includes key elements matching the benchmark (onset ~July 1, 2025; similarity to prior pregnancy but earlier/more intense; OB referral for injections; splints with poor sleep). However, it adds non-HPI items (imaging deferral and plan to inject today), and omits job detail included in benchmark. Not penalized for right-hand dominance which is not in the transcript."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Accurately reflects verbatim exam from transcript: clean/dry/intact skin without erythema/ecchymosis; 'Got PCTS'; decreased sensation to middle fingers. Minor wording matches transcript."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Transcript explicitly states 'X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy,' which the benchmark captures. Candidate returned '-', missing this detail."

      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Exact diagnostic content match: bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Captures injections recommended, risks/temporary nature discussed, performing injections today, and follow-up in three months if symptoms persist postpartum. Misses the plan note about ongoing splint use and poor sleep included in the benchmark."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 30,
  "percentage": 85.71,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark on chief complaint, assessment, and musculoskeletal exam, and mostly matches the plan. HPI covers key history but includes non-HPI items (imaging/plan) and omits employment detail. Imaging field missed the explicit 'X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy.' Overall, solid clinical alignment with a few sectioning and completeness issues."
