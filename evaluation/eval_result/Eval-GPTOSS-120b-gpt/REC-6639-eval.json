      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Includes correct reasons for splint removal and desire for guidance, but adds exam/objective details (laceration status, suture removal, pain severity, limited flexion) not appropriate for HPI and not present in the benchmark."

    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Contains all benchmark exam statements and preserves meaning; includes extra transcript phrases ('On exam, um,' and 'Sutures removed today...') not in benchmark, making it close but not a perfect match."

  "total_score": 26,
  "percentage": 74.29,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note correctly captured the patient name and chief complaint and closely reflected the plan and musculoskeletal exam, though it added some extra verbatim content. The HPI improperly included exam details and an unsupported pain severity, and the assessment diverged significantly from the benchmark. Overall, content accuracy was mixed with strengths in identification and plan elements but weaknesses in HPI discipline and assessment alignment."
