      "justification": "Accurately captures worsening since 2019 (notably past 6 months), denial of numbness/tingling, significant pain/limitation, and relevant history. Minor inaccuracy by stating he 'received injections today' when the transcript indicates injections were planned for today."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark on patient name, chief complaint, MSK exam, and plan. HPI is largely accurate but slightly overstates that injections were already given. Imaging is under-documented, missing right-hand calcific arteriogram and all left-hand findings. Assessment omits bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Overall, clinically sound with a few notable omissions."
