      "justification": "The chief complaint is clearly 'left middle finger trigger finger' per the transcript and benchmark, but the candidate left it as '-'. Major missing content."

      "justification": "Accurately includes recurrence, prior injection date (10/22/24), and that an injection was performed today. It omits the stated detail that he will return to clinic if recurrence occurs, which appears in the benchmark, resulting in a minor omission."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate accurately captured the assessment, plan, and most of the HPI with appropriate restraint and no hallucinations. However, it missed explicitly stated basics—patient name and chief complaint—and omitted a minor follow-up detail in the HPI. Otherwise, formatting and content fidelity were strong for the remaining fields."
