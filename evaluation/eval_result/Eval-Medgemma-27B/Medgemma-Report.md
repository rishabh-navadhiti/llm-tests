| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | The BENCHMARK_NOTE includes 'Linda Omansky' as the patient's name, which is considered the ground truth. The CANDIDATE_NOTE left this field empty, resulting in a major content difference as the patient's name is a critical identifier. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The BENCHMARK_NOTE concisely states 'Numbness and tingling in the right hand'. The CANDIDATE_NOTE adds 'Reevaluation for' which provides additional context not typically included in a chief complaint, thus deviating from the benchmark's more focused and concise phrasing. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The CANDIDATE_NOTE's HPI is largely accurate but contains minor wording differences (e.g., 'recently' vs 'just', 'less frequently' vs 'less') and notably omits the concluding sentence 'She is here for evaluation and treatment' which is present in both the transcript and BENCHMARK_NOTE. The BENCHMARK_NOTE also includes a date not in the transcript, but the candidate's instructions for HPI prevented adding such information, hence no penalty for its absence. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | While the CANDIDATE_NOTE attempts to be verbatim as per its instructions, it deviates significantly from the BENCHMARK_NOTE's interpreted and corrected content. Specifically, 'A one foley' (candidate) differs from 'A1 pulley' (benchmark), and '.pcgs are normal' (candidate) differs from '.PCTS' (benchmark). The benchmark's content, despite being a correction/interpretation from the transcript, is the target ground truth, making the candidate's verbatim (but different) content incorrect in this comparison. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | The BENCHMARK_NOTE states 'XR - Deferred.', while the CANDIDATE_NOTE states 'X-ray is clear.' These are factually contradictory statements. Although the candidate verbatim matches the transcript ('X-ray is clear'), the benchmark is the ground truth for evaluation, indicating a major content difference. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | The CANDIDATE_NOTE's assessment is largely incorrect and fails to adhere to its own instructions. It includes symptoms ('Right hand numbness and tingling', 'Right thumb burn') and exam findings ('Right small finger nodule') not intended for an 'assessment' section as per typical note style or the benchmark's concise 'Trigger finger.'. Crucially, it includes 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.', both of which are either normal findings explicitly meant to be excluded by one of its own rules, or factually incorrect given the transcript's 'Moderate tenderness'. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The CANDIDATE_NOTE's plan captures the main points but introduces additional phrasing and interpretations not present in the BENCHMARK_NOTE or transcript (e.g., 'administer a steroid injection today' instead of 'she would like another today', 'suspected carpal tunnel syndrome', 'if symptoms persist or worsen'). It also violates its own instruction to 'User numbers instead of word where necessary' by writing 'two months' instead of '2 months'. |

**Total Score:** 13

**Percentage:** 37.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed poorly, scoring only 37.14%. It struggled significantly with factual accuracy and adherence to the benchmark, particularly in fields like Patient Name, Imaging Results, and Assessment where content was either entirely missing, factually incorrect compared to the benchmark, or included irrelevant details. While the candidate sometimes adhered more strictly to verbatim transcription (Musculoskeletal, Imaging) it was penalized when the benchmark itself was a corrected/interpreted version, highlighting a conflict in evaluation criteria. The HPI and Plan sections showed minor deviations in phrasing and included some inferences not present in the benchmark, further reducing scores.

| PATIENT_NAME | 3 | The benchmark note, as the ground truth, corrected the spelling from the dictated "Coffee" to "Kaffee". The candidate note retained the uncorrected spelling from the transcript, resulting in a factual inaccuracy compared to the benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate's 'Pain in left index finger' and the benchmark's 'Left index finger pain' convey the exact same meaning, with only minor wording differences. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note misses two significant pieces of information from the transcript: the pain 'has gotten worse' and the patient 'wants to know if she can have an injection now'. It also misinterprets 'It was bothering her when she came in for her shoulder appointment' as 'The pain worsened prior to a shoulder appointment'. Additionally, it uses 'Dr. Almadroa' while the benchmark, as the corrected ground truth, uses 'Dr. Dellamaggiora'. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | While the candidate note adhered to its internal instruction to be verbatim, it does not match the benchmark. The benchmark, as the corrected ground truth, cleaned up filler words and corrected dictated inaccuracies such as 'tacky' to 'intact', 'A1 polii' to 'A1 pulley', and 'walking catching' to 'locking and catching'. The candidate note retains these uncorrected details and fillers, leading to multiple discrepancies when compared to the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate note is verbatim from the transcript. The benchmark adds 'left index finger' for greater clarity, which is consistent with the overall context of the note. This is a minor wording difference, and the core meaning remains preserved. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Both notes correctly identify the patient's conditions. However, the benchmark uses the more concise and standard medical diagnosis 'Trigger finger' compared to the candidate's 'Left index finger triggering', which is slightly less formal but still conveys the correct information. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate note includes a clear hallucination: 'Patient education provided regarding the procedure', which is not mentioned in the transcript. Additionally, it interprets 'plan trigger' as 'plan trigger finger release', which is an addition not explicitly dictated, whereas the benchmark maintains the more direct 'Plan trigger'. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates moderate performance, with several fields showing good accuracy while others exhibit significant shortcomings. Strengths include accurately capturing the chief complaint and adequately extracting imaging results. However, the note struggles with the HPI and Plan sections, missing crucial details and introducing hallucinations. The Musculoskeletal section, while following its verbatim instruction, deviates significantly from the corrected benchmark, highlighting a conflict between direct transcription and clinical accuracy/correction. The patient's name and assessment also show minor discrepancies compared to the benchmark's refined content.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name for the first case (which this note pertains to) is not explicitly mentioned in the transcript. Both the benchmark and candidate notes correctly reflect this by having no patient name for this field. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate note perfectly matches the benchmark and accurately extracts the chief complaint 'Left small finger locking and catching' directly from the transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate note accurately summarizes the HPI, including details like 'right-hand dominant designer' and the onset and reason for delayed treatment, which are well-supported by the transcript. It aligns closely with the benchmark, though it omits the benchmark's inferred statement about symptoms impacting job performance, which was not explicitly stated in the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Despite the candidate's internal instruction to be 'verbatim,' the core task is to match the benchmark note. The candidate's verbatim extraction, 'Um, at the small finger aim of fluid is nodule that is triggering that excellent range of motion overall,' is medically unclear and significantly differs from the benchmark's clinically relevant interpretation: 'Moderate tenderness to palpation at the small finger A1 pulley. Nodule palpable. Excellent range of motion overall.' This constitutes a major content difference in a critical exam finding. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The candidate note completely fails to include any imaging results. The transcript clearly states, 'X-rays are normal,' which is accurately reflected in the benchmark note. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | While the candidate correctly identifies 'Left small finger trigger finger' as an assessment, it violates its own instructions by including 'Left upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.' These are normal findings and exam details explicitly excluded by the field's instructions, and are not present in the benchmark, representing a significant hallucination/deviation. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate correctly states the planned 'surgical release' and 'patient is not having any other triggers today'. However, it fails to include the crucial follow-up information present in the benchmark ('Return to clinic in 2 weeks'), which is a significant omission. It also includes extraneous details ('X-rays were normal') and hallucinates 'I discussed the plan with the patient', which is not in the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 18

**Percentage:** 51.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed moderately, with perfect scores in Patient Name and Chief Complaint. However, it struggled significantly with fields requiring extraction of specific clinical details (Musculoskeletal and Imaging Results) and adherence to its own complex instructions (Assessment and Plan). The note demonstrated a tendency to hallucinate or misinterpret details, leading to major content discrepancies compared to the benchmark, particularly in critical clinical sections like Imaging and Musculoskeletal exam findings.

| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | The `BENCHMARK_NOTE` includes 'Susan Shell' for the patient's name. The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` provides an empty content list `[]`. While the name is not present in the transcript, the benchmark is considered the ground truth, making the candidate note's complete omission a major content difference. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 0 | The `BENCHMARK_NOTE` correctly identifies 'Wrist pain' as the chief complaint, which is clearly stated in the transcript ('significant limited in all things by her... wrist pain'). The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` completely failed to extract this information, resulting in empty content. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The `BENCHMARK_NOTE` provides a detailed HPI based on the transcript, covering the knee replacement, improved synovitis, osteoporosis infusion, and interest in wrist arthroplasty. The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` is completely empty for this section, missing all relevant details from the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The `BENCHMARK_NOTE` has '-' for this field, indicating no specific verbatim musculoskeletal findings to report. The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` has an empty content list `[]`, which effectively conveys the same meaning of no specific findings being captured or needing to be noted. Despite the doctor's comment about deleting a nodule (which is an instruction to modify a previous note, not a new finding to report), both notes align on presenting an empty/default state for this field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The `BENCHMARK_NOTE` states 'Imaging mostly unchanged', accurately reflecting the doctor's comment 'The imaging you can leave all the same'. The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` is completely empty for this field, missing this factual information. |

| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 0 | The `BENCHMARK_NOTE` correctly lists several plan details, including interest in total wrist arthroplasty and planning for the procedure. This information is directly from the transcript. The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` is completely empty for this section, missing all plan details. |

**Total Score:** 6

**Percentage:** 17.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed very poorly across most fields. It completely failed to extract crucial information for Chief Complaint, HPI, Imaging Results, Assessment, and Plan, all of which were clearly stated in the transcript and present in the benchmark. While it functionally matched the benchmark's empty entry for Musculoskeletal findings, and missed the Patient Name (which was in the benchmark but not the transcript), its inability to process and summarize the core clinical conversation into the designated fields is a significant weakness.

| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | The benchmark includes a patient name ('Sandra Herrara') which is not present in the provided transcript. The candidate note correctly did not hallucinate a name, but also failed to return its specified default value ('-'), instead providing an empty array. Given the benchmark is the ground truth, the field is considered mostly incorrect due to the absence of the required information from the benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | The benchmark provides 'Follow up for hand pain' as the chief complaint, which is an inference from the context of the conversation (previous injection, exam findings related to hand/wrist). The transcript does not explicitly state this. The candidate note returned an empty array and did not use its default value ('-'). As the benchmark is ground truth, the candidate is considered mostly incorrect for missing this inferred but expected information. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The benchmark content ('She reports previous injection did not offer any relief. She wants to know what is going on.') is directly and almost verbatim stated in the transcript. The candidate note completely failed to extract this information, returning an empty array. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The transcript contains detailed musculoskeletal exam findings ('hypopigmentation at the dorsal aspect of the CMC... mild over the first dorsal compartment positive finger stain, still a positive, um, grind.'). The candidate's instruction was to extract this verbatim. While the benchmark note expands/interprets some terms, the candidate completely failed to extract any of the verbatim content, returning an empty array. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | No imaging results were mentioned in the transcript, which is correctly reflected by the candidate note not populating this field. However, the candidate's instruction specifies a 'default: -' if no information is found, but it returned an empty array instead, which is a minor formatting/adherence difference. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The benchmark provides 'Pain in hand' as the assessment, which is an inference based on the clinical context in the transcript. The candidate note completely failed to provide any assessment, returning an empty array. As the benchmark is ground truth, this field is considered mostly incorrect. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 0 | The transcript clearly dictates the plan: 'her previous injection offered no relief, recommend trial of, um, dig verban's injection. Return to clinic in six weeks for follow-up.' The benchmark accurately captures this with appropriate medical terminology ('de Quervain's'). The candidate note completely failed to extract any of the plan details, returning an empty array. |

**Total Score:** 7

**Percentage:** 20.0

**Overall Summary:** The AI-generated clinical note performed very poorly, scoring 20% of the maximum possible score. It failed to extract explicit and verbatim information from the transcript for critical fields like History of Present Illness (HPI), Musculoskeletal exam findings, and Plan. For fields where the benchmark likely inferred or used external context (Patient Name, Chief Complaint, Assessment), the candidate produced empty outputs, indicating a significant inability to infer or populate standard note sections. The only field where it showed partial correctness was Imaging Results, by correctly identifying no information was present, though it deviated from its own specified default formatting. Overall, the note demonstrates significant weaknesses in information extraction and clinical inference.

It also omits 'while leaving Groundlings' which is in the benchmark. These are considered missing or incorrect minor details when strictly comparing to the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The benchmark note explicitly states '-' for this field, indicating no content is expected. The candidate note, however, provides detailed musculoskeletal findings verbatim from the transcript. As the benchmark is considered the ground truth, this content is completely incorrect relative to the benchmark's expectation for this specific field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | The candidate note only includes the current X-ray results ('X-rays are normal through these, the wrist, left wrist'). It misses the crucial detail about the urgent care X-rays showing no fractures, which is present in the benchmark ('Left wrist X-rays taken at urgent care showed no fractures'). This constitutes multiple missing details. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note correctly identifies 'Left ECU tendonitis' and 'Left ulnar-sided wrist pain'. However, it omits 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.' which are present in the benchmark.

| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate note includes 'Recommend RE full.' which is absent in the benchmark, even though it is present in the transcript. While the phrasing for return to clinic differs slightly ('Patient to return to clinic after MRI' vs 'Return to clinic after MRI'), the addition of 'RE full' makes it not a perfect match to the benchmark's factual content, categorizing it as incorrect minor details compared to the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 20

**Percentage:** 57.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strong accuracy for basic fields like patient name and chief complaint. However, its performance was significantly impacted by inconsistencies when compared to the benchmark note, which serves as the ground truth. Several fields, particularly 'Musculoskeletal', 'Imaging Results', 'Assessment', and 'Plan', either omitted information present in the benchmark or included details that, while accurate to the transcript, were not present in the benchmark. This highlights a need for better alignment with the specific content expectations of the benchmark for these complex fields.

However, it misses several minor details present in the benchmark, such as 'She is doing okay overall', 'life is difficult at the moment', and the explicit mention of her finally having the nerve studies. The benchmark's HPI is more comprehensive. |

Crucially, it states 'urology consult' instead of the benchmark's 'neurology consult' for radiculopathy, which is considered a major factual error as per the benchmark being the ground truth. It also adds 'to 8 weeks' to the follow-up time, which is not in the benchmark ('6 weeks'). These constitute major content differences and a significant factual error relative to the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 9

**Percentage:** 25.71

**Overall Summary:** The AI-generated clinical note performed poorly against the benchmark. It failed to capture essential information for fields like Patient Name, Chief Complaint, and Imaging Results, resulting in zero scores for these sections. A significant factual error was observed in the Plan section (urology vs. neurology consult) when strictly evaluated against the benchmark, despite the transcript's ambiguity. The Assessment section was also marked down due to the candidate generating content where the benchmark specified an empty field. While the Musculoskeletal field was perfect and the HPI showed partial accuracy, the numerous critical omissions and factual inaccuracies led to a very low overall score.

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in accurately extracting basic patient information and chief complaint. It also effectively captured the imaging results with only minor phrasing differences. However, the note significantly deviated in the Musculoskeletal section by providing content when the benchmark expected none. Additionally, in the HPI and Plan sections, while often more detailed with information from the transcript, the candidate introduced minor factual inaccuracies or missed details (e.g., previous imaging orders, specific follow-up timeframe). The Assessment also showed a minor discrepancy in the description of pain compared to the benchmark. The model sometimes followed its own specific instructions even when they led to content differences from the benchmark, indicating a potential misalignment in instruction sets.

Meaning is mostly preserved. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The benchmark note has '-' for this field, indicating it should be empty or that these details are not captured here. The candidate note, however, provides a verbatim transcription of musculoskeletal exam findings. While the content itself is factually correct and verbatim from the transcript, it represents a major content difference from the benchmark's empty state for this specific field. According to the evaluation criteria, a score of 1 implies 'Major content differences, mostly incorrect' or significant deviation from the benchmark's expectation. |

| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The assessment has multiple inaccuracies. It missed a key diagnosis ('Bilateral thumb and MCP joint masses') explicitly mentioned in the transcript. It also added 'Left wrist retinacular cyst' as a separate condition, which is an imaging finding and likely covered by 'Left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst' in the benchmark, suggesting either a minor hallucination of a distinct condition or incorrect specificity. While it correctly included normal findings ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.') matching the benchmark, this also contradicts its own internal instruction to not include normal findings, making the instruction itself contradictory. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The plan contains a mix of correct inclusions, minor inaccuracies, and slight embellishments. The candidate correctly included 'carpal tunnel release' which was dictated but omitted from the benchmark, making it more complete from a transcript perspective. However, it had minor factual errors such as stating '6 to 8 weeks' instead of the dictated '6 weeks' for follow-up and an added inference ('if it becomes symptomatic') for the aspiration/biopsy.

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in capturing basic patient information such as name and chief complaint, achieving perfect scores in these areas. The HPI and Imaging sections were mostly accurate, with minor stylistic or specificity differences. However, the note struggled significantly with adherence to the benchmark's structure and content in the Musculoskeletal and Assessment sections, either including information where the benchmark was empty or missing key diagnostic details. The Plan section presented a mixed performance, accurately extracting some details omitted by the benchmark while simultaneously introducing minor factual inaccuracies and inferences. The model's adherence to its internal instructions sometimes conflicted with matching the benchmark's output, particularly for the Musculoskeletal and Assessment fields.

The benchmark, in contrast, cleaned these up. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate note perfectly matches the benchmark's imaging results. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note correctly identified 'Stiff fingers' as an assessment item. However, it failed to include 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.', which are present in the benchmark and derived from the transcript's 'pin sites clean dry and intact' and 'no significant tenderness'. The specific instructions within the candidate's prompt for this field indicate these should be included if present. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | The candidate note captures most details of the plan accurately, including the full scope of the follow-up instructions ('likely pin removal or repeat X-rays transition to phenylplastic splint') and the referral to Eliza Cherian.

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in transcribing verbatim sections and capturing detailed information, especially evident in the Musculoskeletal and Imaging fields. It accurately extracted the core HPI and most of the Plan, often retaining more detail from the transcript than the benchmark. However, its main weaknesses lie in accurately identifying the Chief Complaint based on patient statements and fully adhering to the specific (and sometimes contradictory) instructions for the Assessment section, leading to omission of relevant findings present in the benchmark.

The instruction stated 'Do not include normal findings such as “skin is intact” or “no tenderness to palpation.”', yet it also provided contradictory instructions to include them if present. Furthermore, 'No tenderness to palpation' was a hallucination as it was not mentioned in the transcript. This constitutes major content differences and a hallucination. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | While some plan points align with the benchmark (injections, follow-up), the `CANDIDATE_NOTE` significantly deviates by inferring 'Continue wearing splints' without the crucial context of their inadequacy, and incorrectly including 'X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy, to be planned.' in the plan section, which the `BENCHMARK_NOTE` correctly placed in Imaging Results and is not explicitly a 'plan' action in the transcript's plan discussion. This represents multiple missing details and misplacement of information. |

**Total Score:** 16

**Percentage:** 45.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated inconsistent performance. It achieved high accuracy in verbatim extraction for the Musculoskeletal section and good adherence for Chief Complaint. However, it struggled significantly with comprehensive information capture (Patient Name, Imaging Results) and appropriate information placement/filtering for HPI, Assessment, and Plan fields. The presence of contradictory instructions within the candidate's own prompts (Assessment) led to the inclusion of inappropriate and even hallucinated content, leading to a low score for those critical sections. The overall score indicates a need for substantial improvement in understanding clinical note structure and instruction adherence.

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name 'Greta Griswana' is perfectly matched in both the candidate and benchmark notes. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The benchmark lists 'Forearm pain, thumb pain'. The candidate only states 'Right thumb pain'. The doctor explicitly mentioned both 'forearm pain is better' and 'thumb pain is killing her', so the forearm pain, even if improving, was part of the chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate captures the primary complaint and patient's inquiry but significantly misses key HPI details regarding the daughter's wedding and its impact on the patient's hand use and overall pain status. This constitutes multiple missing details. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | The candidate's content is nearly verbatim but misses the initial phrase 'Right upper extremity' which was part of the doctor's dictation for the exam findings. This is a minor omission from the verbatim requirement. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate's 'X-rays reviewed. It will be planned arthritis.' is an excellent match to the doctor's 'X-rays reviewed. It'll be planned arthritis.' and the benchmark's 'X-rays reviewed. It shows planned arthritis.' The candidate's wording is arguably closer to the verbatim spoken word. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate completely misses the key assessment/diagnosis 'Planned arthritis' derived from the X-rays, which is present in the benchmark. Instead, it provides a list of exam findings and normal findings ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.'), which directly contradicts the instruction 'Do not include normal findings such as “skin is intact” or “no tenderness to palpation.”'. This is a complete misinterpretation of the instruction and a fabrication of irrelevant details. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate correctly identifies the steroid injection and follow-up. However, it includes 'the potential need for surgical intervention,' which was not mentioned by the doctor in the plan dictation. This constitutes a minor hallucination, leading to a score of 2. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in extracting basic patient information and accurately transcribing verbatim sections for musculoskeletal and imaging findings. However, its performance significantly declined in more interpretative and summarization tasks. It missed crucial details in the HPI, completely failed to identify the correct assessment, and introduced hallucinations in the plan, indicating a weakness in synthesizing information and adhering to complex, sometimes conflicting, instructions.

| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The `PATIENT_NAME` field is completely empty in the `CANDIDATE_NOTE`, whereas the `BENCHMARK_NOTE` correctly identifies the patient as 'Jedediah Voltz'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` includes 'Left index finger pain and stiffness', adding 'Left' compared to the `BENCHMARK_NOTE`'s 'Index finger pain and stiffness'. While 'left' is implied clinically, it's a minor wording difference from the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate's HPI paragraph is generally accurate but misses several specific details present in the benchmark, such as 'Status post chisel versus index finger', 'Dorsal index finger proximal interphalangeal laceration', and the visit date '8.6.2025'. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | While the candidate adhered to its instruction to be verbatim, the `BENCHMARK_NOTE` represents the corrected ground truth. The candidate includes filler words ('um'), uses abbreviations ('PIP') where the benchmark expands them, and has minor wording differences ('sensory tenderness' vs 'specific tenderness', 'digit' vs 'digits') compared to the benchmark's refined content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The `CANDIDATE_NOTE`'s content 'X-rays are normal.' is a perfect and exact match to the `BENCHMARK_NOTE`. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate's assessment ('Left index finger PIP stiffness', 'Left index finger laceration, healing') is factually accurate and even more clinically precise (adding 'PIP' and 'healing') than the benchmark ('Stiff left index finger', 'Laceration of the left index finger'). However, it is not an exact word-for-word match to the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate missed a key detail ('Plan proximal interphalangeal') present in the benchmark. Additionally, it copied a likely transcription error from the transcript ('image motion' instead of 'range of motion') which the benchmark correctly interpreted and refined. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in directly extracting information when it aligns with the benchmark (e.g., Imaging Results). However, it struggles in fields requiring interpretation, summarization, or correction of raw transcript data to match the clinically refined `BENCHMARK_NOTE`. Significant omissions (Patient Name, part of Plan) and inclusion of transcription errors/less refined phrasing (Musculoskeletal, Plan) indicate areas for improvement in transforming raw dictation into a polished clinical note.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name 'Chaz Thomas' is perfectly matched in the candidate note. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The benchmark states 'Follow-up' which is verbatim from the transcript. The candidate adds 'for laceration' which is an additional detail not requested for the Chief Complaint, violating the instruction to provide 'only the patient's chief complaint without any additional details or context'. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate note accurately captures the core HPI details regarding the splint removal and patient's inquiry. However, it adds 'The patient is here for a follow-up visit' which, while true for a clinical note, was not explicitly dictated as part of the HPI content by the doctor, thus slightly deviating from 'Include information only if explicitly stated in the transcript' for the HPI narrative. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note provides a perfect verbatim extraction of the musculoskeletal exam findings as dictated in the transcript, fully adhering to the instruction. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both the benchmark and candidate correctly indicate no imaging results for this patient, which is consistent with the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate correctly identifies 'laceration' as the primary active condition, which is factual. However, it adds 'Right forearm', which is a specific location not explicitly stated in the transcript for this patient's laceration. The benchmark for this field was also problematic, listing findings (skin intact) that were factually incorrect given a laceration was present. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate note accurately captures most of the plan items (transition to removable splint, hand therapy, return to clinic). However, it incorrectly includes 'Sutures removed today' as a plan item. This was a procedure completed during the visit (as indicated in the musculoskeletal exam), not a future action or recommendation for the patient, which is the typical scope of the 'Plan' section. |

**Total Score:** 28

**Percentage:** 80.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in accurately extracting verbatim information for the musculoskeletal exam and correctly noting the absence of imaging results. The patient's name was also captured perfectly. However, the note struggled with adhering to strict instructions for the Chief Complaint and Assessment, introducing minor unstated details or assumptions. A significant point of error was including a completed procedure within the 'Plan' section, indicating a misunderstanding of what constitutes a forward-looking plan. Despite these issues, the core clinical information was largely accurate and preserved.

| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The candidate note identified the patient name as 'Spencer', which is completely incorrect. The benchmark and transcript clearly indicate the patient is 'Kathy Smith'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 0 | The candidate note provided the chief complaint for the first patient discussed in the transcript (DIP joint pain), not for Kathy Smith. Kathy Smith's chief complaint was swelling and pain in hand, and follow-up for hand surgery. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate note summarized the HPI for the first patient with DIP arthritis, not Kathy Smith. Kathy Smith's HPI was related to her post-surgical follow-up and dissatisfaction with hand therapy. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The candidate note extracted the musculoskeletal exam findings for the first patient (DIP joints, trapeziometic carpal joint), not for Kathy Smith. The benchmark accurately reflected Kathy Smith's post-surgical exam findings. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The candidate note provided imaging results for the first patient with DIP/CMC arthritis. No imaging was mentioned for Kathy Smith in the transcript, which the benchmark correctly indicated with '-'. Thus, this is completely incorrect for the intended patient. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate note listed assessments for the first patient (DIP/CMC arthritis), not for Kathy Smith, whose assessment was post-hand surgery, swelling, and pain. The information provided is completely irrelevant to Kathy Smith. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 0 | The candidate note detailed the plan for the first patient (steroid injections, DIP fusion, splint use, etc.), not for Kathy Smith. Kathy Smith's plan involved continuing therapy, returning to Jack for hand therapy, and a 6-week follow-up. The information provided is completely incorrect for the intended patient. |

**Total Score:** 0

**Percentage:** 0.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed extremely poorly, scoring 0 across all fields. It consistently extracted information pertaining to a different patient (the first patient discussed in the transcript regarding DIP/CMC arthritis) instead of the intended patient, Kathy Smith. This resulted in every field containing factually incorrect or irrelevant information for the target patient. The model failed to identify and focus on the correct patient's segment within the provided transcript.

| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The candidate note completely failed to extract the patient's name, leaving the content field empty, which is a critical omission. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate note accurately identified and extracted 'Bilateral thumb pain' as the chief complaint, perfectly matching the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate note captured the core HPI details accurately, including the worsening of pain, duration, and associated symptoms (denial of numbness/tingling, reported pain and limitation). However, it included an introductory sentence about the patient being a 'right-handed male retiree presenting for evaluation of bilateral thumb pain,' which, while factual from the transcript, was not part of the benchmark's concise HPI summary, making it a minor addition not explicitly requested for the HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The benchmark note explicitly has '-' for this field, indicating no verbatim musculoskeletal findings were to be included or extracted as per the ground truth's design for this specific field. The candidate note, however, extracted significant verbatim content, directly contradicting the benchmark's intended empty state. This constitutes a major content difference. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | The candidate note verbatim included the instruction 'except you can delete the "calcific arterio-"' instead of interpreting it to reflect the actual imaging finding for the left hand (absence of calcific arteriogram). This is a significant functional error as it presents an instruction rather than a result. There were also minor wording/grammatical differences compared to the benchmark's more refined phrasing. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate note missed the 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' finding, which was specifically requested to be included in the instructions for this field if present in the transcript. Additionally, it omitted the word 'syndrome' from 'Bilateral carpal tunnel' and 'Right cubital tunnel,' which are minor but consistent omissions compared to the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate note provided a highly comprehensive and accurate summary of the plan, closely mirroring the benchmark's content. Minor wording variations ('potential rebound pain' vs 'possibility of rebound pain', 're-exist' vs 're-emerge', 'two months' vs '2 months') do not alter the meaning and align well with the instruction's emphasis on conversational tone. 'Re-exist' is verbatim from the transcript, making it a faithful capture. |

**Total Score:** 20

**Percentage:** 57.14

**Overall Summary:** The AI-generated note demonstrated good performance in accurately extracting the Chief Complaint and the detailed Plan, adhering well to the conversational style specified for the latter. However, it completely failed to extract the patient's name. Significant issues were noted in the Musculoskeletal Verbatim section, where it extracted content contrary to the benchmark's intended empty state. The Imaging Results section incorrectly included a verbatim instruction instead of an interpreted result, and the Assessment section missed a specific instruction regarding skin integrity and omitted key diagnostic terms. Overall, the note shows promise in some areas but struggles with adherence to specific field requirements and contextual interpretation in others.

| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The HPI provided by the candidate describes the history of a different patient (with DIP and trapeziometic carpal joint issues), not Cathy Smith. The information is entirely irrelevant to the target patient. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The musculoskeletal findings listed are for a different patient (describing DIP and trapeziometic carpal joint angulation/deformity), not Cathy Smith, whose exam findings included 'incisions well healed' and 'A1 pulley incision' details. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The imaging results provided are for a different patient (detailing DIP joint space narrowing from 2002 images), not Cathy Smith, for whom no imaging results were dictated in the relevant section of the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | The assessment lists conditions (DIP and trapeziometic carpal joint arthritis, DIP joint fusion) relevant to a different patient, not Cathy Smith. Cathy Smith's assessment should have been 'Hand swelling' and 'Hand pain'. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 0 | The plan details interventions for CMC and DIP arthritis (steroid injections, fusion consideration) which are for a different patient, not Cathy Smith. Cathy Smith's plan was to 'Continue therapy. Transition care with Jack. Return to clinic in 6 weeks.' |

**Total Score:** 0

**Percentage:** 0.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note completely failed to extract information for the intended patient, Cathy Smith. Instead, all fields contain information pertaining to a different patient discussed earlier in the transcript. This resulted in zero factual accuracy for any of the fields for the target patient.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate note perfectly matches the benchmark for the chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate included demographic information ('right-handed male retiree') in the HPI, which is outside the specified scope of the HPI section (onset, duration, location, severity, etc.) as per the instructions, even though it is factually correct from the transcript. Minor wording differences preserved meaning. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate note includes 'bilateral' instead of 'Right' and adds 'Um, dot NCTS.', deviating from the benchmark note. While the candidate is more verbatim to the raw transcript, the benchmark note is considered the ground truth after human review, making these differences a factual discrepancy against the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | The candidate included filler words ('Um, moderate... no') and a direct instruction from the doctor ('you can delete the "calcific arterio-"') instead of interpreting it as a clinical finding ('except no calcific arteriogram'), which is a minor factual misrepresentation/lack of interpretation compared to the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate missed including 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' from the benchmark, which, despite potentially contradictory instructions, was present in the human-reviewed benchmark as an expected item for this field. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed well on direct factual extraction tasks like Patient Name and Chief Complaint, and excelled in the Plan section by providing comprehensive details and correctly following the specified formatting instructions, even outperforming the benchmark in instruction adherence. However, it struggled with interpretation and scope adherence in the HPI, Imaging Results, and Assessment sections, often including verbatim transcript elements or omitting details not present in the benchmark, despite the benchmark being designated as the ground truth. The MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM field highlights a conflict between verbatim extraction (which the candidate performed perfectly according to instruction) and adherence to the benchmark's edited content.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The candidate note perfectly matches the patient's name as provided in the transcript and benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The benchmark note states 'Left middle finger trigger finger' which is a concise and typical chief complaint. The candidate note adds 'Recurrence of', which while factually correct from the transcript, is generally considered a detail better placed in the HPI or Assessment rather than the Chief Complaint itself, which typically focuses on the core condition. This is a minor wording difference. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note incorrectly reverses the chronological order of events. The transcript states the injection occurred on 10-22-24, followed by recurrence. The candidate states the patient experienced recurrence, then 'previously underwent' the injection, which is a significant factual error in the timeline of the History of Present Illness. The candidate also correctly omits the plan element, which the benchmark includes, but the chronological error is more critical for HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note correctly indicates that no specific musculoskeletal findings were dictated, aligning with the transcript and benchmark. It followed its instruction to return empty. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate note correctly indicates that no imaging results were dictated, aligning with the transcript and benchmark. It followed its instruction to return empty. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate note's assessment 'Recurrence of left middle finger trigger finger' is highly accurate and appropriate given the doctor's emphasis on recurrence in the transcript. While the benchmark's 'Trigger finger of the left middle finger' is also correct, the candidate's version is more specific to the current presentation. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate note accurately captures all elements of the plan from the transcript, including the detail 'today' for the injection. It also adheres to the specified formatting instructions (numbered list). The minor wording difference 'experiences' vs 'has' for recurrence does not detract from factual accuracy. |

**Total Score:** 31

**Percentage:** 88.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed well in most fields, demonstrating strong factual accuracy and adherence to specific formatting instructions for Plan. It particularly excelled in capturing the precise context for Assessment and correctly identifying empty fields. However, a significant drawback was the chronological error in the HPI, which misrepresented the sequence of events. The Chief Complaint was slightly over-detailed compared to common clinical note conventions.
