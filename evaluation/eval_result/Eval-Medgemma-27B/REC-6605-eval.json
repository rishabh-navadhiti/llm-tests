    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The patient's name for the first case (which this note pertains to) is not explicitly mentioned in the transcript. Both the benchmark and candidate notes correctly reflect this by having no patient name for this field."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note perfectly matches the benchmark and accurately extracts the chief complaint 'Left small finger locking and catching' directly from the transcript."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate note accurately summarizes the HPI, including details like 'right-hand dominant designer' and the onset and reason for delayed treatment, which are well-supported by the transcript. It aligns closely with the benchmark, though it omits the benchmark's inferred statement about symptoms impacting job performance, which was not explicitly stated in the transcript."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Despite the candidate's internal instruction to be 'verbatim,' the core task is to match the benchmark note. The candidate's verbatim extraction, 'Um, at the small finger aim of fluid is nodule that is triggering that excellent range of motion overall,' is medically unclear and significantly differs from the benchmark's clinically relevant interpretation: 'Moderate tenderness to palpation at the small finger A1 pulley. Nodule palpable. Excellent range of motion overall.' This constitutes a major content difference in a critical exam finding."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The candidate note completely fails to include any imaging results. The transcript clearly states, 'X-rays are normal,' which is accurately reflected in the benchmark note."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "While the candidate correctly identifies 'Left small finger trigger finger' as an assessment, it violates its own instructions by including 'Left upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.' These are normal findings and exam details explicitly excluded by the field's instructions, and are not present in the benchmark, representing a significant hallucination/deviation."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate correctly states the planned 'surgical release' and 'patient is not having any other triggers today'. However, it fails to include the crucial follow-up information present in the benchmark ('Return to clinic in 2 weeks'), which is a significant omission. It also includes extraneous details ('X-rays were normal') and hallucinates 'I discussed the plan with the patient', which is not in the transcript."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 18,
  "percentage": 51.43,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note performed moderately, with perfect scores in Patient Name and Chief Complaint. However, it struggled significantly with fields requiring extraction of specific clinical details (Musculoskeletal and Imaging Results) and adherence to its own complex instructions (Assessment and Plan). The note demonstrated a tendency to hallucinate or misinterpret details, leading to major content discrepancies compared to the benchmark, particularly in critical clinical sections like Imaging and Musculoskeletal exam findings."
