    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The benchmark includes a patient name ('Sandra Herrara') which is not present in the provided transcript. The candidate note correctly did not hallucinate a name, but also failed to return its specified default value ('-'), instead providing an empty array. Given the benchmark is the ground truth, the field is considered mostly incorrect due to the absence of the required information from the benchmark."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The benchmark provides 'Follow up for hand pain' as the chief complaint, which is an inference from the context of the conversation (previous injection, exam findings related to hand/wrist). The transcript does not explicitly state this. The candidate note returned an empty array and did not use its default value ('-'). As the benchmark is ground truth, the candidate is considered mostly incorrect for missing this inferred but expected information."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark content ('She reports previous injection did not offer any relief. She wants to know what is going on.') is directly and almost verbatim stated in the transcript. The candidate note completely failed to extract this information, returning an empty array."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The transcript contains detailed musculoskeletal exam findings ('hypopigmentation at the dorsal aspect of the CMC... mild over the first dorsal compartment positive finger stain, still a positive, um, grind.'). The candidate's instruction was to extract this verbatim. While the benchmark note expands/interprets some terms, the candidate completely failed to extract any of the verbatim content, returning an empty array."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "No imaging results were mentioned in the transcript, which is correctly reflected by the candidate note not populating this field. However, the candidate's instruction specifies a 'default: -' if no information is found, but it returned an empty array instead, which is a minor formatting/adherence difference."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The benchmark provides 'Pain in hand' as the assessment, which is an inference based on the clinical context in the transcript. The candidate note completely failed to provide any assessment, returning an empty array. As the benchmark is ground truth, this field is considered mostly incorrect."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The transcript clearly dictates the plan: 'her previous injection offered no relief, recommend trial of, um, dig verban's injection. Return to clinic in six weeks for follow-up.' The benchmark accurately captures this with appropriate medical terminology ('de Quervain's'). The candidate note completely failed to extract any of the plan details, returning an empty array."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 7,
  "percentage": 20.0,
  "overall_summary": "The AI-generated clinical note performed very poorly, scoring 20% of the maximum possible score. It failed to extract explicit and verbatim information from the transcript for critical fields like History of Present Illness (HPI), Musculoskeletal exam findings, and Plan. For fields where the benchmark likely inferred or used external context (Patient Name, Chief Complaint, Assessment), the candidate produced empty outputs, indicating a significant inability to infer or populate standard note sections. The only field where it showed partial correctness was Imaging Results, by correctly identifying no information was present, though it deviated from its own specified default formatting. Overall, the note demonstrates significant weaknesses in information extraction and clinical inference."
