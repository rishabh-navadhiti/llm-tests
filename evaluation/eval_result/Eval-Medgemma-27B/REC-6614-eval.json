    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate note's HPI is largely accurate but has minor wording differences and omissions compared to the benchmark. It missed 'children's' for social worker, used 'ultrasound of the wrist' instead of 'ultrasound of the anterior wrist', and included 'She is here for evaluation and treatment' which the benchmark implicitly omits from the HPI summary. Meaning is mostly preserved."

    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The benchmark note has '-' for this field, indicating it should be empty or that these details are not captured here. The candidate note, however, provides a verbatim transcription of musculoskeletal exam findings. While the content itself is factually correct and verbatim from the transcript, it represents a major content difference from the benchmark's empty state for this specific field. According to the evaluation criteria, a score of 1 implies 'Major content differences, mostly incorrect' or significant deviation from the benchmark's expectation."

    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The imaging results are largely accurate with only minor wording and grammatical differences ('show' vs 'showed', 'noted', and 'MCP joint of the thumb' vs 'thumb MCP joint'). The meaning is preserved."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The assessment has multiple inaccuracies. It missed a key diagnosis ('Bilateral thumb and MCP joint masses') explicitly mentioned in the transcript. It also added 'Left wrist retinacular cyst' as a separate condition, which is an imaging finding and likely covered by 'Left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst' in the benchmark, suggesting either a minor hallucination of a distinct condition or incorrect specificity. While it correctly included normal findings ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.') matching the benchmark, this also contradicts its own internal instruction to not include normal findings, making the instruction itself contradictory."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The plan contains a mix of correct inclusions, minor inaccuracies, and slight embellishments. The candidate correctly included 'carpal tunnel release' which was dictated but omitted from the benchmark, making it more complete from a transcript perspective. However, it had minor factual errors such as stating '6 to 8 weeks' instead of the dictated '6 weeks' for follow-up and an added inference ('if it becomes symptomatic') for the aspiration/biopsy. Compared to the benchmark, it has both additional information and incorrect minor details."

  "total_score": 24,
  "percentage": 68.57,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in capturing basic patient information such as name and chief complaint, achieving perfect scores in these areas. The HPI and Imaging sections were mostly accurate, with minor stylistic or specificity differences. However, the note struggled significantly with adherence to the benchmark's structure and content in the Musculoskeletal and Assessment sections, either including information where the benchmark was empty or missing key diagnostic details. The Plan section presented a mixed performance, accurately extracting some details omitted by the benchmark while simultaneously introducing minor factual inaccuracies and inferences. The model's adherence to its internal instructions sometimes conflicted with matching the benchmark's output, particularly for the Musculoskeletal and Assessment fields."
