    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The benchmark correctly identifies 'No pain' as the patient's chief complaint, as directly stated by the doctor ('he states that he has no pain'). The candidate note lists 'Follow-up', which is the reason for the visit but not the specific complaint mentioned by the patient regarding their current status."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate note's HPI is largely accurate ('He reports no pain and wants to know what is going on.'). However, it includes 'The patient is here for follow-up', which is contextual information but typically excluded from a strict HPI summary focusing only on the patient's subjective history, as per the instruction. The meaning is preserved, but it's a minor deviation from strict HPI formatting."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note accurately transcribes the musculoskeletal findings verbatim from the transcript, including the filler words 'Uh' and 'um' as explicitly required by the instruction 'Must be extract what doctor has dictated, Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.'. The benchmark, in contrast, cleaned these up."

      "justification": "The candidate note perfectly matches the benchmark's imaging results."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate note correctly identified 'Stiff fingers' as an assessment item. However, it failed to include 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.', which are present in the benchmark and derived from the transcript's 'pin sites clean dry and intact' and 'no significant tenderness'. The specific instructions within the candidate's prompt for this field indicate these should be included if present."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate note captures most details of the plan accurately, including the full scope of the follow-up instructions ('likely pin removal or repeat X-rays transition to phenylplastic splint') and the referral to Eliza Cherian. While there is a slight redundancy in repeating 'Continue plexal ligament split', the candidate's version retains more fidelity to the spoken details for the follow-up compared to the benchmark which condensed and omitted some specifics. The candidate's structure aligns well with 'Return in multiples sentence in lists'."

  "total_score": 27,
  "percentage": 77.14,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in transcribing verbatim sections and capturing detailed information, especially evident in the Musculoskeletal and Imaging fields. It accurately extracted the core HPI and most of the Plan, often retaining more detail from the transcript than the benchmark. However, its main weaknesses lie in accurately identifying the Chief Complaint based on patient statements and fully adhering to the specific (and sometimes contradictory) instructions for the Assessment section, leading to omission of relevant findings present in the benchmark."
