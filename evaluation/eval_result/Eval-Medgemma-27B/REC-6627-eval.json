  "field_scores": {
    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` completely omitted the patient's name, which is present in the `BENCHMARK_NOTE`. Although the name is not in the transcript, the benchmark (ground truth) includes it. This is a major content difference."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` correctly identifies the chief complaint. The only minor difference is the use of a comma instead of 'and' before 'burning pain', which is a minor wording/formatting difference and preserves the meaning."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` provides an accurate summary of the HPI symptoms as stated in the transcript. However, it omits the patient's profession ('pharmacist') and the initial diagnosis ('Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome') which are included in the `BENCHMARK_NOTE`'s HPI section, even though they might be considered general information or a diagnosis rather than strictly HPI narrative. These are considered minor missing details when comparing to the benchmark."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` provides a highly verbatim extraction of the musculoskeletal findings, adhering very closely to the transcript and its specific instruction for this field ('Must be extract what doctor has dictated, Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.'). It is arguably more verbatim than the `BENCHMARK_NOTE` in some instances (e.g., 'Got PCTS, uh,' vs '.PCTS')."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` completely failed to extract any imaging results, leaving the field empty. The transcript clearly states 'X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy' and the `BENCHMARK_NOTE` correctly includes this information."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` correctly identified 'Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome'. However, it included 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.'. The instruction stated 'Do not include normal findings such as “skin is intact” or “no tenderness to palpation.”', yet it also provided contradictory instructions to include them if present. Furthermore, 'No tenderness to palpation' was a hallucination as it was not mentioned in the transcript. This constitutes major content differences and a hallucination."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "While some plan points align with the benchmark (injections, follow-up), the `CANDIDATE_NOTE` significantly deviates by inferring 'Continue wearing splints' without the crucial context of their inadequacy, and incorrectly including 'X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy, to be planned.' in the plan section, which the `BENCHMARK_NOTE` correctly placed in Imaging Results and is not explicitly a 'plan' action in the transcript's plan discussion. This represents multiple missing details and misplacement of information."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 16,
  "percentage": 45.71,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated inconsistent performance. It achieved high accuracy in verbatim extraction for the Musculoskeletal section and good adherence for Chief Complaint. However, it struggled significantly with comprehensive information capture (Patient Name, Imaging Results) and appropriate information placement/filtering for HPI, Assessment, and Plan fields. The presence of contradictory instructions within the candidate's own prompts (Assessment) led to the inclusion of inappropriate and even hallucinated content, leading to a low score for those critical sections. The overall score indicates a need for substantial improvement in understanding clinical note structure and instruction adherence."
