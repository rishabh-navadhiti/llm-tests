      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The benchmark states 'Follow-up' which is verbatim from the transcript. The candidate adds 'for laceration' which is an additional detail not requested for the Chief Complaint, violating the instruction to provide 'only the patient's chief complaint without any additional details or context'."

    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate note accurately captures the core HPI details regarding the splint removal and patient's inquiry. However, it adds 'The patient is here for a follow-up visit' which, while true for a clinical note, was not explicitly dictated as part of the HPI content by the doctor, thus slightly deviating from 'Include information only if explicitly stated in the transcript' for the HPI narrative."

      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note provides a perfect verbatim extraction of the musculoskeletal exam findings as dictated in the transcript, fully adhering to the instruction."

    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Both the benchmark and candidate correctly indicate no imaging results for this patient, which is consistent with the transcript."

    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The candidate correctly identifies 'laceration' as the primary active condition, which is factual. However, it adds 'Right forearm', which is a specific location not explicitly stated in the transcript for this patient's laceration. The benchmark for this field was also problematic, listing findings (skin intact) that were factually incorrect given a laceration was present."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The candidate note accurately captures most of the plan items (transition to removable splint, hand therapy, return to clinic). However, it incorrectly includes 'Sutures removed today' as a plan item. This was a procedure completed during the visit (as indicated in the musculoskeletal exam), not a future action or recommendation for the patient, which is the typical scope of the 'Plan' section."

  "total_score": 28,
  "percentage": 80.0,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in accurately extracting verbatim information for the musculoskeletal exam and correctly noting the absence of imaging results. The patient's name was also captured perfectly. However, the note struggled with adhering to strict instructions for the Chief Complaint and Assessment, introducing minor unstated details or assumptions. A significant point of error was including a completed procedure within the 'Plan' section, indicating a misunderstanding of what constitutes a forward-looking plan. Despite these issues, the core clinical information was largely accurate and preserved."
