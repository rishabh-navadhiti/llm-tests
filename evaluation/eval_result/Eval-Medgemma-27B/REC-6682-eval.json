    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The benchmark note states 'Left middle finger trigger finger' which is a concise and typical chief complaint. The candidate note adds 'Recurrence of', which while factually correct from the transcript, is generally considered a detail better placed in the HPI or Assessment rather than the Chief Complaint itself, which typically focuses on the core condition. This is a minor wording difference."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate note incorrectly reverses the chronological order of events. The transcript states the injection occurred on 10-22-24, followed by recurrence. The candidate states the patient experienced recurrence, then 'previously underwent' the injection, which is a significant factual error in the timeline of the History of Present Illness. The candidate also correctly omits the plan element, which the benchmark includes, but the chronological error is more critical for HPI."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note correctly indicates that no specific musculoskeletal findings were dictated, aligning with the transcript and benchmark. It followed its instruction to return empty."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note correctly indicates that no imaging results were dictated, aligning with the transcript and benchmark. It followed its instruction to return empty."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note's assessment 'Recurrence of left middle finger trigger finger' is highly accurate and appropriate given the doctor's emphasis on recurrence in the transcript. While the benchmark's 'Trigger finger of the left middle finger' is also correct, the candidate's version is more specific to the current presentation."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note accurately captures all elements of the plan from the transcript, including the detail 'today' for the injection. It also adheres to the specified formatting instructions (numbered list). The minor wording difference 'experiences' vs 'has' for recurrence does not detract from factual accuracy."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 31,
  "percentage": 88.57,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note performed well in most fields, demonstrating strong factual accuracy and adherence to specific formatting instructions for Plan. It particularly excelled in capturing the precise context for Assessment and correctly identifying empty fields. However, a significant drawback was the chronological error in the HPI, which misrepresented the sequence of events. The Chief Complaint was slightly over-detailed compared to common clinical note conventions."
