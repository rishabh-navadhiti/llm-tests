| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The candidate note hallucinates the patient's name as 'Spencer', which is incorrect. The transcript does not provide the patient's name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate note 'Increasing numbness and tingling in the right hand' accurately captures the chief complaint from the transcript, including the 'increasing' detail, which is a perfect match in factual content. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate note accurately summarizes most of the HPI details. However, it omits the date ('8.6.2025') present in the benchmark. Additionally, it includes information about the prior injection and the patient's request for another injection, which, while historical, is more typically placed in the plan/assessment rather than strictly HPI as per the instruction 'Do not include exam findings, imaging results, or any objective measurements' (even though 'treatments received' is allowed, the specific request for a new injection leans more towards plan). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The candidate note fails significantly in providing a verbatim transcription as per the instructions. It misses 'Bilateral upper extremities' and 'Skin is clean, dry and intact without erythema or ecchymosis'. Crucially, it misinterprets 'A1 pulley' as 'A one foley' and '.PCTS' as '.pcgs are normal', indicating major transcription errors. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | The candidate note states 'X-ray is clear.' which is verbatim from the transcript. However, the BENCHMARK_NOTE (ground truth) has corrected this to 'XR - Deferred.'. Since the evaluation is against the benchmark, the candidate note's content is a major factual difference compared to the benchmark, resulting in a low score. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note's assessment is much broader than the benchmark's ('Trigger finger.'). While it includes relevant conditions like 'Right hand numbness and tingling' and 'Right thumb sensory deficit secondary to burn', which are supported by the transcript, it also includes an exam finding ('palpable nodule') which goes against the instruction 'Do not include any exam findings'. The inclusion of 'Right upper extremity skin is intact' is contradictory to the general instruction 'Do not include normal findings', even though there's a specific override for 'skin is intact' if present, the benchmark does not include it. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate note perfectly captures all the elements of the plan from the transcript. It rephrases the information into conversational and coherent sentences while preserving all factual content and adhering to the instruction's stylistic requirements. |

**Total Score:** 17

**Percentage:** 48.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in summarizing the Chief Complaint and the Plan, accurately extracting and rephrasing information while adhering to specified instructions. However, it performed poorly in identifying the patient's name, which was a hallucination. The musculoskeletal exam section contained significant verbatim errors and omissions. The HPI was mostly accurate but missed a date and included a detail that was slightly out of scope based on the benchmark. The Imaging Results, while transcript-accurate, diverged from the benchmark's corrected content. The Assessment was broader than the benchmark and included an exam finding, indicating inconsistency with instructions and benchmark scope.

| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | The candidate note used 'Nicole Coffee' which is directly from the transcript. The benchmark note corrected the spelling to 'Nicole Kaffee'. While the candidate accurately transcribed, the benchmark represents the corrected ground truth, making this a minor factual difference. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate note stated 'Pain in left index finger' which is slightly different wording from the benchmark's 'Left index finger pain'. Both accurately convey the chief complaint, representing a minor wording difference. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate note accurately summarizes the HPI, including details like 'previous patient', 'new condition', and correctly identifies 'Dr. Almadroa' as per the transcript. The benchmark incorrectly names the doctor as 'Dr. Dellamaggiora' and includes a date not present in the HPI portion of the transcript. The candidate's summary is factually superior and adheres to the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note perfectly adheres to the 'verbatim' instruction for this field, reproducing the doctor's dictation exactly, including filler words and informal phrasing. The benchmark note significantly rephrased and added details not present in the transcript (e.g., 'intact', 'ecchymosis', 'to palpation') and omitted some dictated content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate note is a perfect verbatim match to the transcript's description of the imaging results. The benchmark note added 'left index finger' which was an inference not explicitly stated in the dictation for the imaging results. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate correctly identified 'Left index finger triggering with A1 pulley involvement'. However, it hallucinates 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation', which directly contradicts the transcript's findings of 'left upper extremity' and 'Acute moderate tenderness on left index finger'. This represents major factual errors despite potentially following its own conflicting instructions. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate note accurately states 'The patient will not receive an injection at this time'. However, it significantly hallucinates additional plan details such as 'manage the condition conservatively with close observation', 'patient was educated', and 'Follow-up in 6 to 8 weeks'. None of these crucial plan details are mentioned in the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed exceptionally well in accurately transcribing verbatim sections (Musculoskeletal, Imaging) and capturing the essence of the HPI, even outperforming the benchmark in these areas by adhering more closely to the raw transcript. However, its performance severely degraded in the Assessment and Plan sections due to significant hallucination and factual errors, particularly in the Assessment where it contradicted exam findings and hallucinated findings for the wrong side. The candidate also struggled with following instructions for the Assessment section, which appeared to be contradictory within its own prompt.

| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The patient's name 'Spencer' is not mentioned in the transcript for the first patient. The benchmark correctly indicates this by having a placeholder ('-'). The candidate's inclusion of 'Spencer' is a hallucination or an inference from the field key names, not from the spoken transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate note perfectly matches the benchmark and accurately extracts the chief complaint 'Left small finger locking and catching' from the transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate's HPI is comprehensive and accurately reflects details from the transcript, including 'right-hand dominant designer' and 'no other triggering episodes', which are not present in the benchmark. The main minor issue is the inclusion of 'Spencer' as the patient's name when it's not explicitly stated in the transcript for this patient. The benchmark also includes an inference about symptoms impacting the patient's job, which the candidate correctly omits based on its instruction not to infer. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note strictly adheres to its instruction to extract the information verbatim from the doctor's dictation. While the benchmark provides a more clinically interpreted phrasing, the candidate's output is an exact match to the spoken words, fulfilling its specific instruction. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate accurately extracts 'X-rays are normal' from the transcript. The benchmark adds 'of the left small finger', which is a contextual inference not explicitly stated in the transcript for the imaging result itself. The candidate's output is factually correct based on the explicit dictation, making it a minor difference in specificity rather than accuracy. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | While the primary diagnosis 'Left small finger trigger finger with palpable nodule' is largely correct, the candidate includes two subsequent points that are factually incorrect based on the transcript and contradict its own instructions ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact' is wrong as the transcript refers to the left hand, and 'No tenderness to palpation' is explicitly contradicted by 'moderate tenderness to palpation' in the transcript). This makes a significant portion of the assessment inaccurate. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate note's plan is largely fabricated or incorrectly derived. The transcript for the first patient only clearly states 'planned trigger' (implying surgical release). The candidate hallucinates 'observation and non-surgical options', 'avoid repetitive gripping activities', 'gradual return to activity', '6 to 8 weeks for re-evaluation', and 'discuss potential for surgical intervention if symptoms persist or worsen'. Most of these details are not present in the transcript for the first patient, or are incorrectly pulled from the second patient's plan and misrepresented. |

**Total Score:** 20

**Percentage:** 57.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates mixed performance. It excels in fields requiring verbatim extraction (Musculoskeletal) and accurately captures chief complaint. The HPI is detailed and largely accurate, though it incorrectly adds a patient name not present in the transcript. However, the note significantly struggles with the Assessment and Plan sections, fabricating details, contradicting itself, and misattributing information from a different patient encounter in the transcript. The handling of the patient's name is also a notable factual error.

| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | The benchmark note includes 'Susan Shell' as the patient's name, which was a human correction to the note. The candidate note returned an empty content array. While the name was not explicitly stated in the transcript, the benchmark establishes the expected output for this field. Therefore, the candidate note is missing a key piece of information present in the ground truth. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 0 | The benchmark correctly identifies 'Wrist pain' as the chief complaint, which is explicitly mentioned in the transcript ('She feels like she is significantly limited in all things by her... wrist pain'). The candidate note returned empty content, completely missing this crucial detail. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The benchmark note accurately summarizes the History of Present Illness with multiple details from the transcript (knee replacement, improved synovitis, rheumatologist injection, osteoporosis infusion, wrist pain, interest in total wrist arthroplasty). The candidate note returned empty content, indicating a complete failure to extract and summarize the HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The benchmark note has '-' as content, implying no specific verbatim musculoskeletal findings were to be recorded from the transcript. The doctor stated 'Exam mostly unchanged, except you can delete the large, poorly defined nodule,' which is an instruction rather than a finding. The candidate note returned empty content, which aligns with the instruction 'If not information is found, please return empty' and perfectly matches the benchmark's intent of having no specific verbatim finding. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The benchmark note correctly states 'Imaging mostly unchanged' based on the doctor's comment 'The imaging you can leave all the same.' The candidate note returned empty content, completely missing this factual information regarding imaging results. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | The benchmark note correctly identifies 'Bilateral wrist arthritis' and 'Synovitis' as relevant medical conditions from the transcript. The candidate note returned empty content, completely failing to list any conditions for the assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 0 | The benchmark note provides a detailed plan based on the doctor's statements about wrist arthroplasty, synovitis, and knee recovery, and planning for the wrist procedure. The candidate note returned empty content, demonstrating a complete failure to extract and summarize the plan of action. |

**Total Score:** 6

**Percentage:** 17.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed extremely poorly across almost all fields. It failed to extract any factual information for the Chief Complaint, HPI, Imaging Results, Assessment, and Plan, consistently returning empty content where significant details were present in the transcript. While it scored perfectly on the Musculoskeletal section by correctly identifying the absence of verbatim findings, this single correct extraction does not compensate for the widespread failure to process and populate critical clinical sections. The performance indicates a fundamental issue in information extraction from the provided transcript.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The candidate note completely failed to extract the patient's name. Although the name 'Sandra Herrara' is not present in the provided transcript, the benchmark note, considered the ground truth, explicitly includes it. Thus, the candidate note is missing a critical piece of information that is expected in the final output. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 0 | The candidate note left the Chief Complaint field empty. The benchmark note, however, provides 'Follow up for hand pain'. While not explicitly stated verbatim in the brief transcript, this is a standard clinical summarization that the benchmark provides as ground truth. The candidate note completely misses this relevant information. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate note completely missed the HPI information. The transcript clearly states 'injection did not offer any relief. Uh, she wants to know what is going on,' which is accurately captured in the benchmark. The candidate note's failure to extract this directly stated HPI content is a major omission. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate note attempts a verbatim extraction as per its internal instruction, but this conflicts with the benchmark's nature as a corrected, structured note. The candidate note reproduces 'CMC during' instead of 'carpometacarpal joint' and 'finger stain' instead of 'Finkelstein', which are less precise and medically incorrect versions of the spoken words compared to the benchmark's corrected terms. It also fails to parse the findings into distinct points as the benchmark does, and misses the implied 'tenderness to palpation'. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The transcript does not contain any imaging results. Both the candidate note and the benchmark note correctly reflect this by leaving the content empty or marked with a hyphen, indicating no information. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate note completely misunderstands the 'Assessment' field. It lists physical exam findings ('hypopigmentation', 'tenderness', 'positive tests') and even a normal finding ('Skin is intact') despite its own instruction to 'Do not include any exam findings' and 'Do not include normal findings'. The benchmark correctly provides a concise problem/diagnosis 'Pain in hand'. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate note captures most of the plan accurately, but it fails to apply medical knowledge by transcribing 'dig verban's' instead of the correct medical term 'de Quervain's', which is a significant factual inaccuracy. It also fails to adhere to its own formatting instruction to 'User numbers instead of word where necessary' by writing 'six weeks' instead of '6 weeks'. |

**Total Score:** 10

**Percentage:** 28.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed poorly, scoring 10 out of a possible 35 points (28.57%). It demonstrated significant weaknesses in extracting crucial information (Patient Name, Chief Complaint, HPI) that was present in the benchmark (ground truth), even if not explicitly stated in the limited transcript snippet provided. For fields where information was extracted (Musculoskeletal, Plan), the candidate note often opted for a verbatim transcription, which conflicted with the benchmark's corrected and clinically refined content. This resulted in factual inaccuracies (e.g., 'dig verban's' vs 'de Quervain's') and a lack of proper clinical structuring. The 'Assessment' field was a complete misinterpretation, including inappropriate content such as exam findings and normal findings. The only field where the candidate note performed perfectly was 'Imaging Results', correctly identifying the absence of information.

| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | The candidate correctly identified 'Stephanie Humphrey'. However, it also included other patient names from the transcript, which is extraneous given the benchmark note focuses on a single patient. This represents a partial adherence to instructions for a single-patient note. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate correctly identified 'Left wrist pain' for Stephanie Humphrey. Similar to the patient name field, it included chief complaints for other patients mentioned in the transcript, making it less precise for a single patient's note. This is a minor formatting difference where meaning for the specific patient is preserved. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's HPI section for Stephanie Humphrey severely violated its own instruction: 'Do not include exam findings, imaging results, or any objective measurements.' It included extensive exam findings, imaging results, and even plan details. While the historical HPI content itself was largely accurate, the inclusion of inappropriate content types makes the section's overall composition fundamentally incorrect. This constitutes a major content difference. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The benchmark note for this field is '-'. The candidate provided detailed verbatim musculoskeletal examination findings from the transcript. Although the candidate's extracted content is factually accurate from the transcript, it directly contradicts the benchmark's empty content for this field. As the benchmark is the ground truth, this is a major content difference. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | The candidate's imaging results ('X-rays are normal through these, the wrist, left wrist.') only included the current X-ray findings. It missed the detail about the urgent care X-rays ('Left wrist X-rays taken at urgent care showed no fractures') which was present in the transcript and included in the benchmark. This represents a missing minor detail. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate's assessment for Stephanie Humphrey perfectly matched all items in the benchmark, including 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.' even though the former appears to be a factual error (should be 'Left' based on the transcript) that the benchmark included. Since the benchmark is considered the ground truth, a perfect match to it earns a score of 5. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate included an introductory sentence summarizing the assessment ('For Stephanie Humphrey: Left ECU tendonitis and left ulnar-sided wrist pain.'), which is not part of the plan in the benchmark. More critically, the candidate hallucinated the follow-up time ('in 6 to 8 weeks') for 'Return to clinic after MRI', a detail not present in the transcript, likely due to its own instruction. This combination of an additional detail and a minor hallucination warrants a score of 2. |

**Total Score:** 20

**Percentage:** 57.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated mixed performance. It accurately extracted specific factual details and perfectly matched the benchmark for the Assessment section, even replicating a potential error from the benchmark. However, it significantly underperformed in the HPI section by failing to adhere to instructions regarding content inclusion, and for the Musculoskeletal section by providing content where the benchmark expected none. A minor hallucination was also noted in the Plan section. The note also broadly extracted information for all patients in some fields, rather than focusing on a single patient as implied by the benchmark structure, leading to extraneous information.

| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The candidate note incorrectly identified the patient's name as 'Spencer', which is likely the doctor's name, not the patient's. The transcript does not mention the patient's name, and the benchmark uses a placeholder name 'Susan Oakes'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The candidate note includes 'intermittent electric sensations' as part of the chief complaint. While mentioned as a symptom, the primary chief complaint for the follow-up, as per the transcript and benchmark, is 'wrist achiness and limited motion'. Including secondary symptoms makes the chief complaint less concise and accurate for its intended purpose. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note incorrectly includes 'Her physical exam findings are unchanged from prior visits' and 'She continues to gain strength and has tolerated advanced activity and laboring without issue'. The instructions explicitly state 'Do not include exam findings... or any objective measurements'. The benchmark correctly omits these details. This represents multiple missing details OR minor hallucination by including prohibited content. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note correctly returned an empty array, indicating no verbatim musculoskeletal findings were dictated, which aligns with the transcript and the instruction 'If not information is found, please return empty'. The benchmark also correctly indicated no specific content with '-'. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate note accurately provides the specific details of the nerve study results as dictated in the transcript ('No evidence of carpal tunnel. There is perhaps some evidence of ulnar nerve compression at Guyon's canal, though the patient is not symptomatic in that distribution.'). This is a perfect and more detailed match compared to the benchmark's general 'Nerve study results'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The benchmark's content for this field is completely empty, which is incorrect. The candidate note correctly identifies most relevant conditions/symptoms (5 points). However, it incorrectly includes 'Right upper extremity skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation'. These are not verbatim from the transcript and contradict the primary instruction to 'Do not include normal findings' in the assessment of medical conditions. While there's a contradictory instruction at the end, the initial rule and the nature of an 'assessment' section dictate their exclusion. This constitutes a minor hallucination/incorrect detail based on a strict interpretation of the instructions and the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | The candidate note accurately captures all key elements of the plan from the transcript. However, there are minor wording differences, such as 'rehabilitation' instead of 'laboring' and using words ('six', 'September') instead of numbers ('6', '9-1') for dates, despite the instruction to 'User numbers instead of word where necessary'. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated good factual accuracy in several key areas such as Imaging Results and Musculoskeletal findings. However, its performance was significantly hindered by a critical error in identifying the patient's name and by failing to strictly adhere to instructions in the HPI and Assessment fields, particularly regarding the exclusion of exam findings and the inclusion of non-primary details in the Chief Complaint. The Plan section was largely accurate but showed minor deviations in wording and formatting from instructions.

It includes additional introductory details from the transcript which are not present in the benchmark, representing minor wording differences, but the core meaning is preserved. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The benchmark note explicitly lists '-' (empty) for this field. The candidate note, however, provides extensive verbatim content from the transcript regarding musculoskeletal findings. While this content is present in the transcript and aligns with the field's instruction to extract verbatim if information is found, it represents a major content difference when strictly compared to the benchmark's designated empty field. This is a significant divergence from the 'ground truth' benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The factual content of the imaging results is identical to the benchmark. The only differences are minor variations in verb tense (e.g., 'show' vs 'showed', 'demonstrates' vs 'demonstrated'). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate correctly identified some diagnoses but inaccurately interpreted 'bilateral' as 'Bilateral osteophytes' when the benchmark specifies 'Bilateral hand pain'. This is a significant incorrect detail, as it represents a different medical condition. Minor wording difference in 'MCP joint osteophyte' vs 'MCP osteophyte' is negligible. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate note provides good contextualization for some plan points (e.g., 'for carpal tunnel symptoms', 'The masses are not currently bothersome; therefore,'). However, it includes an inferred condition for aspiration/biopsy ('if symptoms develop or if there is progression') that was not explicitly stated by the doctor in the transcript. This constitutes an incorrect minor detail or minor hallucination. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in accurately extracting basic patient demographic information and chief complaint. It captures the essence of the HPI and Imaging results well, with only minor linguistic differences. However, the note significantly deviates in the Musculoskeletal section by populating a field that the benchmark explicitly marked as empty, indicating a mismatch in expected content. Furthermore, in the Assessment and Plan sections, the model shows a tendency to infer or add details not explicitly stated in the transcript, leading to factual inaccuracies or minor hallucinations when compared to the strict ground truth of the benchmark. This highlights a need for improvement in adhering to the exact scope and content specified by the benchmark, even when transcript information might suggest otherwise for a verbatim field, and in avoiding unsubstantiated inferences.

While 'Left first dorsal compartment retinacular cyst' is more specific due to imaging, the benchmark uses the initially stated 'wrist cyst'. The 'osteophytes' vs 'masses' difference is a factual inaccuracy. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | The candidate note misses some specificity for night splints ('for the left wrist' vs. 'regarding the masses').

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed well in extracting fundamental information such as patient name and chief complaint, and accurately transcribed imaging results with only minor stylistic differences. However, its performance was significantly impacted by a divergence from the benchmark's expected content in the Musculoskeletal section, where it provided detailed exam findings while the benchmark was empty. Additionally, there were minor factual inaccuracies or imprecise phrasing in the HPI and Assessment sections, particularly concerning the nature of the bilateral thumb and MCP joint issues. The candidate's adherence to its own detailed instructions for the Plan section led to a more verbose output compared to the benchmark's conciseness.

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in direct verbatim extraction (Musculoskeletal) and accurate factual extraction (Imaging Results). However, its quality significantly declined in fields requiring more complex interpretation and adherence to specific, sometimes contradictory, instructions. The History of Present Illness (HPI) contained numerous extraneous details, including prohibited exam findings and imaging results, leading to a low score. The Chief Complaint was overly descriptive. The Assessment field struggled with identifying relevant active conditions versus exam findings and adhering to precise phrasing rules. The Plan section showed weaknesses in logical structuring, misinterpreting temporal details, and including unsubstantiated inferences.

| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate correctly identifies 'Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome'. However, it incorrectly includes 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.'. The benchmark's content for this field does not include these normal findings, and the instruction explicitly states 'Do not include normal findings such as “skin is intact” or “no tenderness to palpation.”'. Furthermore, 'No tenderness to palpation.' is a hallucination as it is not present in the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate missed a significant detail included in the benchmark's plan: 'She has already been wearing splints without enough improvement to be able to sleep through the night'. While the candidate's phrasing is generally good, this omission and the inference of 'corticosteroid' (not in transcript or benchmark) result in a score reduction. |

**Total Score:** 19

**Percentage:** 54.28

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed moderately, accurately identifying the chief complaint and providing a largely correct HPI. However, it struggled with adherence to the precise scope and formatting of several fields as defined by the benchmark, frequently including extraneous information (e.g., 'IMAGING_RESULTS') or omitting key details (e.g., 'PLAN_SPENCER_'). Significant issues include a hallucinated patient name and inaccuracies in the 'ASSESSMENT_SPENCER' field, where it included normal findings and a hallucination despite explicit instructions to avoid them (and contradiction in instructions, but evaluated against benchmark's final content).

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name is correctly identified as 'Greta Griswana', matching the benchmark exactly. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The candidate note only lists 'Thumb pain' as the chief complaint. The transcript explicitly mentions 'forearm pain is better' and 'thumb pain is killing her', indicating both were chief complaints. The candidate missed 'Forearm pain'. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate note contains significant hallucinated details not present in the transcript (e.g., pain began gradually, no previous management, denies trauma, no systemic symptoms, no other joints involved). It also incorrectly includes an exam finding ('localized to the right upper extremity, specifically at the trapeziometacarpal joint') in the HPI, violating instructions. It also missed the relevant HPI detail about the daughter's wedding. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | The candidate note is mostly verbatim but omits 'Right upper extremity' which was stated at the beginning of the musculoskeletal exam findings in the transcript ('it's her right upper termine. Significant...'). This is a minor omission from an otherwise verbatim section. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | The candidate note rephrases 'planned arthritis' as 'degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis)' and adds 'at the trapeziometacarpal joint', which was not explicitly stated in the imaging results given by the doctor. The benchmark accurately reflected the doctor's 'planned arthritis' statement. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | While 'Right trapeziometacarpal joint osteoarthritis' is a plausible diagnosis derived from the context, the candidate note includes three additional points that violate the instructions: 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' (normal finding), 'No tenderness to palpation' (normal finding, and partially contradicted by specific tenderness in other areas), and 'Tenderness to palpation at trapeziometacarpal joint' (an exam finding, not an assessment/diagnosis). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate note accurately captures all elements of the plan from the transcript, including the steroid injection, discussion of temporary nature, procedure/postoperative protocol, and the 8-week follow-up with the contingency 'if symptoms persist'. The phrasing aligns well with the conversational style requested. |

**Total Score:** 23

**Percentage:** 65.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in extracting specific verbatim details, particularly for the patient's name and the comprehensive treatment plan. However, it struggles significantly with adherence to specific instructions for the HPI and Assessment sections, leading to notable hallucinations (HPI) and the inclusion of exam/normal findings (Assessment) despite explicit negative constraints. There were also minor inaccuracies in the Chief Complaint and Imaging Results due to omissions or non-verbatim interpretations. Overall, the model needs substantial improvement in following nuanced instructions and differentiating between subjective history, objective findings, and diagnostic assessments.

| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The candidate note hallucinates "Spencer" as the patient's name. The patient's name is not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, and "Spencer" appears to refer to the doctor based on field names, making this completely incorrect for the patient. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate note accurately identifies the core chief complaint but adds "following laceration," which provides HPI context and makes it slightly less concise than a standard chief complaint, as seen in the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note includes accurate details about the HPI but violates instructions by including an exam finding ("limited to about 10 degrees of active flexion") and negatives not explicitly stated in the HPI section of the transcript ("no reported history of infection, numbness, or tingling"). It also incorrectly uses "Spencer" as the patient's name. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note provides a near-perfect verbatim transcription of the musculoskeletal exam findings, including filler words like 'um,' which adheres strictly to the instruction to 'Must be extract what doctor has dictated, Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.' |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Perfect match in factual content with the benchmark note. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate note includes multiple exam findings ("Moderate soft tissue swelling", "No tenderness to palpation") and a hallucinated normal finding ("Right upper extremity Skin is intact."), which directly violates the explicit instruction to "Do not include any exam findings or historical medical information" and "Do not include normal findings" in the assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate note accurately captures all key plan elements (hand therapy, 4-week follow-up with motion assessment). It also appropriately includes the detail about normal X-rays, which is relevant information and reasoning from the doctor's discussion, aligning with the instruction to 'Mention any relevant findings or explanations discussed with the patient, and reflect how the provider explains the reasoning behind the treatment.' |

**Total Score:** 22

**Percentage:** 62.857142857142854

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in transcribing verbatim sections and extracting imaging results. However, it significantly struggles with adhering to specific instructions for certain fields, particularly HPI and Assessment, where it includes prohibited information (exam findings, normal findings, hallucinations) and misidentifies the patient's name. While it captures the core content of the plan, the overall adherence to strict formatting and inclusion rules is inconsistent, leading to a moderate overall score.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The candidate note perfectly matches the benchmark note for the patient's name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The benchmark note is more concise and adheres better to the instruction to provide 'only the patient's chief complaint without any additional details or context.' The candidate note adds 'for hand laceration and splint removal,' which provides extra context beyond the simple chief complaint of 'Follow-up.' |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate note includes significant exam findings ('The laceration is clean, dry, and intact with sutures in place. Sutures were removed today, and he is tolerating the procedure well without complications.') which explicitly violates the instruction 'Do not include exam findings, imaging results, or any objective measurements.' The benchmark note correctly focuses only on the patient's subjective history and complaints. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note is a precise verbatim extraction of what the doctor stated under the 'On exam' section, aligning perfectly with the instruction to 'Must be extract what doctor has dictated, Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.' The benchmark note omitted a part of the dictated exam findings that were stated as part of the exam. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both the candidate and benchmark notes correctly indicate no imaging results for this patient. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate note correctly identifies and lists the key active issues from the transcript: 'Limited flexion of the right hand', 'Post-surgical suture site healing well', and 'Mild pain at the laceration site'. It also correctly includes 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' per the explicit instruction. The benchmark note missed active issues (limited flexion, mild pain) and incorrectly included a detail not mentioned in the transcript ('No tenderness to palpation'). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | The candidate note captures all key plan elements, including the more complete follow-up instruction ('for follow-up and range of motion check') which is more aligned with a 'conversational tone' as per instructions. The inclusion of 'Sutures were removed today' reflects an action taken during the visit, which is a reasonable interpretation given the contradictory statements in the transcript (sutures removed vs. sutured in today). |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed well in fields requiring verbatim extraction and identifying active issues in the assessment, providing more comprehensive details where appropriate compared to the benchmark. However, it significantly underperformed in the HPI by including objective exam findings, violating a key instruction. The Chief Complaint was also slightly over-detailed compared to the benchmark's conciseness. Overall, the note shows strong potential but needs refinement in adhering to specific content exclusion rules for HPI.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The candidate accurately extracted the patient's name as 'Kathy Smith', matching the benchmark and transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | The candidate's chief complaint is overly detailed, including elements like 'dissatisfaction with hand therapy, and desire to return to Jack for care' which are better suited for the HPI. This violates the instruction to provide 'only the patient's chief complaint without any additional details or context'. The benchmark provides a more concise and appropriate chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate incorrectly includes extensive physical exam findings within the HPI section. This directly violates the instruction: 'Do not include exam findings, imaging results, or any objective measurements.' This is a major factual error in terms of section content. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate meticulously followed the 'verbatim' instruction, accurately extracting the doctor's dictated words, including fillers ('Um,') and medically misspoken terms ('pony incision' instead of 'pulley', 'tendon salvation' instead of 'tendon desquamation'). While the benchmark corrects these, the candidate adhered perfectly to the explicit instruction for verbatim extraction, making it a perfect match to the instruction. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The candidate hallucinated 'X-rays are normal' for Kathy Smith. No imaging results were mentioned for this specific patient in the provided transcript segment. This is completely incorrect and fabricated information. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's assessment section is largely incorrect and violates multiple instructions. It includes normal findings ('Skin is intact', 'No tenderness to palpation', 'Excellent range of motion') and exam findings ('tenderness to palpation at the A1 pulley incision') which are explicitly forbidden by the primary rule 'Do not include normal findings...Do not include any exam findings'. It also completely missed a key assessment point present in the benchmark ('Status post hand surgery'). Although there were some conflicting instructions, the primary intent of 'active symptoms or conditions' was not met. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate accurately captured all essential elements of the plan, including continuing therapy, transitioning care to Jack, and returning to clinic in six weeks. The minor rephrasing ('Transition care to Jack' vs 'Return to Jack for hand therapy') preserves the original meaning perfectly. |

**Total Score:** 19

**Percentage:** 54.28

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in extracting verbatim musculoskeletal exam findings and accurately capturing the patient's name and plan. However, it exhibited significant weaknesses in adhering to instructions for other fields. The Chief Complaint was overly detailed, the HPI incorrectly included exam findings, and a major hallucination occurred in the Imaging Results. The Assessment section was particularly problematic, failing to identify core conditions and including numerous irrelevant details, indicating a misunderstanding or misapplication of field-specific rules. The inconsistent performance suggests a need for improved instruction adherence and factual accuracy, especially concerning hallucinations and content placement.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The chief complaint 'Bilateral thumb pain' is perfectly extracted and matches the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note includes details that are more appropriate for past medical history (e.g., 'history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, right cubital tunnel syndrome, and bilateral thumb CMC joint arthritis') and current treatment ('He has received injections today for bilateral thumb CMC arthritis'), which are typically excluded from a concise HPI summary focused on the present illness. It also includes an inferred negative 'No other new symptoms or systemic complaints were reported' which violates the instruction 'Do not add assumptions, inferred limitations, or negatives unless explicitly stated.' The benchmark provides a more focused HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate perfectly extracted the musculoskeletal physical examination findings verbatim from the transcript, adhering precisely to its specific instruction for this field. The benchmark having a '-' suggests a different field definition, but the candidate followed its instructions correctly. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | The candidate inaccurately states 'moderate to severe joint space narrowing' when the doctor clearly corrected to 'severe joint space neovasculitis'. 'Narrowing' is also incorrect; the term used was 'neovasculitis'. This represents a factual inaccuracy and a missed detail from the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | All listed conditions are accurate and relevant. The candidate also correctly includes 'Right upper extremity skin is intact' as per its specific instruction for this field, despite a general instruction against normal findings, aligning with the benchmark's inclusion. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The plan is comprehensive, accurate, and includes all necessary details such as the recommended injections, discussion points (temporary nature, rebound pain, patient understanding), observation for other conditions, consideration of nerve studies, and follow-up time. It also adds 'patient is doing much better' which is present in the transcript and adds good context. The formatting adheres to the instructions. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.85714285714286

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed well on extracting specific information verbatim (Musculoskeletal) and accurately summarizing the Chief Complaint, Patient Name, Assessment, and Plan sections. However, it struggled with the HPI by including extraneous historical and treatment details not strictly part of the present illness, and made a significant factual error in the Imaging Results by misrepresenting key findings from the transcript. The conflicting instructions within the candidate note for the Assessment section regarding 'normal findings' highlight an internal prompt design issue, though the candidate's adherence to the specific rule for 'skin intact' was noted positively due to its presence in the benchmark.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name 'Cathy Smith' perfectly matches the benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | The candidate's chief complaint includes excessive detail about patient dissatisfaction and desire for care transition, which are typically HPI details, not concise chief complaints. This violates the instruction to provide only the chief complaint without additional context. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate incorrectly included extensive physical exam findings (e.g., 'mild soft tissue swelling noted', 'tenderness and dislocation at the A1 pulley incision site', 'full fist formation and excellent range of motion') within the HPI section, which explicitly violates the instruction 'Do not include exam findings, imaging results, or any objective measurements.' This constitutes a major content deviation from the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | While largely verbatim, the candidate includes disfluencies ('Um', 'uh') present in the raw transcript but not in the clean benchmark. More significantly, it uses 'will heal' instead of 'well healed' and 'pony' instead of 'pulley', which are minor but important inaccuracies when compared to the human-corrected benchmark (ground truth). This reflects missing or incorrect minor details. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The candidate hallucinated imaging results ('X-rays are normal.') for this patient. The transcript does not mention any imaging for Cathy Smith, and the benchmark correctly indicates no imaging. This is completely fabricated content. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate completely failed to provide a list of medical conditions or assessments, instead listing various physical exam findings. It also included normal findings ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.') which the benchmark explicitly excluded for conciseness. This output is entirely incorrect for an assessment section. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | While some plan items are accurate ('Continue therapy.', 'Return to clinic in six weeks for follow-up.'), the candidate included two hallucinatory/inferential statements ('No further imaging or interventions planned at this time.', 'Monitor for healing and symptom progression.') that were not dictated by the physician for this patient. Additionally, the 'transition care' point is more verbose than the concise benchmark, indicating multiple minor details that are incorrect or represent minor hallucinations. |

**Total Score:** 13

**Percentage:** 37.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed poorly, scoring only 37.14%. It struggled significantly with content accuracy and adherence to field-specific instructions, particularly in distinguishing between patient history, exam findings, assessment, and plan. Major errors included incorporating exam findings into the HPI and Assessment sections, and hallucinating imaging results and elements of the plan not dictated in the conversation. While the patient name was perfect, and the musculoskeletal section was close, these strengths were overshadowed by substantial inaccuracies and outright fabrications in other critical sections.

It also adds a negative statement ('No prior trauma or acute injury was reported') not explicitly stated in the transcript, violating the instruction to only include explicitly stated information. The benchmark is more concise and adheres to HPI conventions. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note provides a perfect verbatim transcription of the musculoskeletal exam findings from the transcript, adhering strictly to the instruction 'Must be extract what doctor has dictated, Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.' The benchmark note deviates slightly from verbatim. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | The candidate note incorrectly transcribes 'neovasculitis' as 'narrowing,' which is a significant factual error in medical terminology. It also omits 'three views' and 'with metacarpal' which were present in the transcript. These are multiple missing/incorrect details. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate note accurately identifies the three main medical conditions. It also includes 'progression of disease' which is directly stated in the transcript ('his arthritis has progressed') making it more complete than the benchmark. While it includes 'Right upper extremity skin is intact,' which contradicts a general instruction about normal findings, it aligns with a specific (and contradictory) instruction given for this field and also matches the benchmark's inclusion of this detail (though 'Right' instead of 'bilateral' is a minor deviation from the transcript). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate note generally covers the key aspects of the plan (injections, observation for carpal/cubital tunnel, nerve studies). The follow-up time of '6 to 8 weeks' is an acceptable interpretation of '2 months'. However, the candidate adds 'Patient to contact clinic if symptoms worsen prior to follow-up appointment,' which is not explicitly stated in the transcript and is a minor hallucination/addition to the plan. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed strongly in extracting patient demographic information and verbatim musculoskeletal exam findings. However, it struggled significantly with the HPI and Imaging Results sections, introducing extraneous information/hallucinations in the HPI and factual inaccuracies in Imaging. The Assessment was good, and the Plan was mostly accurate but included an unstated instruction.

Crucially, it omits the last sentence present in the `BENCHMARK_NOTE`'s HPI ('He will return to clinic if he has any recurrence.'), which, while arguably a plan item, is part of the 'ground truth' benchmark for this field. This constitutes a missing detail and a minor hallucination/inference. |

However, it inappropriately includes 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact,' which is a normal finding and explicitly goes against the candidate's own instruction 'Do not include normal findings such as “skin is intact”.' This is a minor hallucination/factual error not supported by the transcript as an assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The `CANDIDATE_NOTE` accurately includes the injection performed and the removal of imaging review. However, it adds a redundant and out-of-place assessment statement ('The patient has had a recurrence of left middle finger trigger finger.') and hallucinates a specific timeframe ('in 6 to 8 weeks') for the follow-up not mentioned in the transcript.

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated good accuracy for basic information like patient name and fields with no dictated content. However, it struggled with complex sections like HPI, Assessment, and Plan. It frequently included redundant or inferred information, and notably hallucinated specific details (e.g., follow-up timeframe, normal exam findings) that were not present in the transcript, often going against general instructions for clinical note quality, despite sometimes being prompted by contradictory specific instructions within its own format. This led to a lower score in these critical clinical sections.
