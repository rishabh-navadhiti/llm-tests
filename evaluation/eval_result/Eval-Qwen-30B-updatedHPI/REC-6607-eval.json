    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The benchmark note includes 'Susan Shell' as the patient's name, which was a human correction to the note. The candidate note returned an empty content array. While the name was not explicitly stated in the transcript, the benchmark establishes the expected output for this field. Therefore, the candidate note is missing a key piece of information present in the ground truth."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark correctly identifies 'Wrist pain' as the chief complaint, which is explicitly mentioned in the transcript ('She feels like she is significantly limited in all things by her... wrist pain'). The candidate note returned empty content, completely missing this crucial detail."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark note accurately summarizes the History of Present Illness with multiple details from the transcript (knee replacement, improved synovitis, rheumatologist injection, osteoporosis infusion, wrist pain, interest in total wrist arthroplasty). The candidate note returned empty content, indicating a complete failure to extract and summarize the HPI."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The benchmark note has '-' as content, implying no specific verbatim musculoskeletal findings were to be recorded from the transcript. The doctor stated 'Exam mostly unchanged, except you can delete the large, poorly defined nodule,' which is an instruction rather than a finding. The candidate note returned empty content, which aligns with the instruction 'If not information is found, please return empty' and perfectly matches the benchmark's intent of having no specific verbatim finding."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark note correctly states 'Imaging mostly unchanged' based on the doctor's comment 'The imaging you can leave all the same.' The candidate note returned empty content, completely missing this factual information regarding imaging results."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark note correctly identifies 'Bilateral wrist arthritis' and 'Synovitis' as relevant medical conditions from the transcript. The candidate note returned empty content, completely failing to list any conditions for the assessment."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark note provides a detailed plan based on the doctor's statements about wrist arthroplasty, synovitis, and knee recovery, and planning for the wrist procedure. The candidate note returned empty content, demonstrating a complete failure to extract and summarize the plan of action."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 6,
  "percentage": 17.14,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note performed extremely poorly across almost all fields. It failed to extract any factual information for the Chief Complaint, HPI, Imaging Results, Assessment, and Plan, consistently returning empty content where significant details were present in the transcript. While it scored perfectly on the Musculoskeletal section by correctly identifying the absence of verbatim findings, this single correct extraction does not compensate for the widespread failure to process and populate critical clinical sections. The performance indicates a fundamental issue in information extraction from the provided transcript."
