    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate included 'Mr.' which is an honorific, whereas the benchmark only included the patient's name 'Parviz Mikael'. While the meaning is preserved, it's a minor wording difference according to the strict instruction to 'Only return the patients name'."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The benchmark correctly identifies 'No pain'. The candidate added 'Follow-up visit with', which is additional context/detail, violating the instruction to 'provide only the patient's chief complaint without any additional details or context'."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate extensively included prohibited information such as imaging results ('The X-rays remain unchanged...') and exam findings ('His fingers remain stiff...', 'no significant tenderness to palpation...'), directly violating the instruction 'Do not include exam findings, imaging results, or any objective measurements.' It also added details not explicitly stated, such as 'He has no new symptoms' and 'There has been no change in his condition since the last visit'."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate's response is a perfect verbatim match to the doctor's dictation, including filler words ('Uh,', 'um,') as implied by the strict instruction 'Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.'."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate provided an exact and perfect match to the benchmark and the transcript for imaging results."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate included 'Stable alignment of the parthenonic carpal' and 'Persistent stiffness in fingers', which are exam findings/observations and not 'active symptoms or conditions' as per the primary rule 'Only include active symptoms or conditions relevant to the current visit.' Also, 'No tenderness to palpation except for stiff fingers' deviates from the specific instruction to 'say ' No tenderness to palpation. '' without modification. The benchmark adhered more closely to the intent of the conflicting instructions by only including the two explicitly mandated 'normal findings'."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate poorly structured the conditional plan for the plexal ligament split ('Continue plexal ligament split.' and 'Review X-rays again.' instead of 'continued plexal ligament split, or review the x-rays and continue plexal ligament split.'). It also misinterpreted the timing, stating 'Plan to proceed with pin removal or repeat X-rays in 10 days,' when the 10 days refers to the follow-up visit. Additionally, 'Transition to phenylplastic splint following the next visit' adds an inference not stated in the transcript."

  "total_score": 22,
  "percentage": 62.857142857142854,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in direct verbatim extraction (Musculoskeletal) and accurate factual extraction (Imaging Results). However, its quality significantly declined in fields requiring more complex interpretation and adherence to specific, sometimes contradictory, instructions. The History of Present Illness (HPI) contained numerous extraneous details, including prohibited exam findings and imaging results, leading to a low score. The Chief Complaint was overly descriptive. The Assessment field struggled with identifying relevant active conditions versus exam findings and adhering to precise phrasing rules. The Plan section showed weaknesses in logical structuring, misinterpreting temporal details, and including unsubstantiated inferences. Overall, the model needs improvement in filtering information based on specific constraints and accurately interpreting nuanced clinical instructions."
