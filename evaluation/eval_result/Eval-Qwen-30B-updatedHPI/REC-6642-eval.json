    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate note includes details that are more appropriate for past medical history (e.g., 'history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, right cubital tunnel syndrome, and bilateral thumb CMC joint arthritis') and current treatment ('He has received injections today for bilateral thumb CMC arthritis'), which are typically excluded from a concise HPI summary focused on the present illness. It also includes an inferred negative 'No other new symptoms or systemic complaints were reported' which violates the instruction 'Do not add assumptions, inferred limitations, or negatives unless explicitly stated.' The benchmark provides a more focused HPI."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate perfectly extracted the musculoskeletal physical examination findings verbatim from the transcript, adhering precisely to its specific instruction for this field. The benchmark having a '-' suggests a different field definition, but the candidate followed its instructions correctly."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate inaccurately states 'moderate to severe joint space narrowing' when the doctor clearly corrected to 'severe joint space neovasculitis'. 'Narrowing' is also incorrect; the term used was 'neovasculitis'. This represents a factual inaccuracy and a missed detail from the transcript."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "All listed conditions are accurate and relevant. The candidate also correctly includes 'Right upper extremity skin is intact' as per its specific instruction for this field, despite a general instruction against normal findings, aligning with the benchmark's inclusion."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The plan is comprehensive, accurate, and includes all necessary details such as the recommended injections, discussion points (temporary nature, rebound pain, patient understanding), observation for other conditions, consideration of nerve studies, and follow-up time. It also adds 'patient is doing much better' which is present in the transcript and adds good context. The formatting adheres to the instructions."

  "total_score": 29,
  "percentage": 82.85714285714286,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note performed well on extracting specific information verbatim (Musculoskeletal) and accurately summarizing the Chief Complaint, Patient Name, Assessment, and Plan sections. However, it struggled with the HPI by including extraneous historical and treatment details not strictly part of the present illness, and made a significant factual error in the Imaging Results by misrepresenting key findings from the transcript. The conflicting instructions within the candidate note for the Assessment section regarding 'normal findings' highlight an internal prompt design issue, though the candidate's adherence to the specific rule for 'skin intact' was noted positively due to its presence in the benchmark."
