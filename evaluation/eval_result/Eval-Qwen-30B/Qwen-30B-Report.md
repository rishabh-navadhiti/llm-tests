| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The candidate note failed to provide a specific patient name, using a pronoun 'She' instead. The benchmark note provides a specific name, 'Linda Omansky', which is the expected output for this field, despite not being in the provided transcript excerpt. The candidate did not match the benchmark's content. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate note included the word 'Increasing,' which is present in the transcript ('noticed increasing numbness and tingling'). The benchmark note omitted this word for conciseness. This is a minor wording difference that preserves the core meaning of the chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate note followed its specific instruction to format the HPI as Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity. However, this resulted in a significant loss of crucial contextual information (lymphoma, chemotherapy, reevaluation, difficulty with earrings/phone, trying to hold phone less) present in the benchmark and transcript. It also inferred 'moderate severity' and included 'small finger' for the numbness/tingling location, which was primarily associated with the physical exam findings, not the HPI symptoms. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate note missed the initial musculoskeletal findings ('Bilateral upper extremty skin is clean, dry and intact without erythema or ecchymosis'). While it was more verbatim on other phrases like '.pcgs are normal' compared to the benchmark's interpretation, the significant omission of content reduces its accuracy based on the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The candidate note states 'X-ray is clear,' which is accurate per the transcript. However, the benchmark note states 'XR - Deferred.' As the benchmark is considered the ground truth for evaluation, the candidate note's factual content is completely incorrect when compared directly to the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note includes 'Right small finger triggering with nodule,' which aligns with the benchmark's 'Trigger finger.' However, the candidate also included other factually correct and relevant assessments from the transcript (numbness/tingling, thumb sensory deficit) that are absent in the benchmark. While these additions are accurate based on the transcript, they constitute major content differences from the benchmark. The inclusion of 'Right upper extremity skin is intact' is also inconsistent with the benchmark and arises from contradictory instructions given to the candidate model. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate note provides a perfectly summarized, scribe-style plan that accurately captures all elements from the transcript and the benchmark. It effectively rephrases conversational dictation into concise, actionable medical notes, fulfilling the instruction for a 'scribe-style summary' and explaining reasoning where appropriate. The factual content is perfectly matched with the benchmark's intent, with improved formatting and conciseness. |

**Total Score:** 14

**Percentage:** 40.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note exhibited significant variability in performance across fields. It performed excellently in the 'Plan' section, providing a well-structured and accurate summary of the doctor's directives. However, it struggled significantly with 'Patient Name' and 'Imaging Results' by providing factually incorrect information compared to the benchmark. The 'HPI' was formatted as per its specific instruction but omitted crucial details present in the benchmark, leading to a sparse summary. The 'Musculoskeletal' and 'Assessment' sections had multiple discrepancies and omissions or additions when compared to the benchmark, indicating a lack of consistent alignment with the 'ground truth' despite sometimes being more comprehensive based on the raw transcript. The note's adherence to instructions was inconsistent, particularly where instructions conflicted or when the benchmark's content deviated from the direct transcript.

| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | The candidate note transcribed 'Nicole Coffee' which is what was dictated. The benchmark note reflects a human correction to 'Nicole Kaffee'. Given the benchmark's history shows 'Coffee' was the original, and the candidate accurately captured the dictated name, it's a very minor difference from the corrected benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate 'Pain in left index finger' and benchmark 'Left index finger pain' convey the exact same meaning. The difference is only in wording order, preserving meaning and adhering to instructions. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate strictly followed its internal instruction to only provide Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity. While accurate for those specific points, it missed significant clinically relevant details from the transcript present in the benchmark's comprehensive HPI (e.g., prior shoulder appointment, Dr. Almadroa's recommendation for observation, and the patient's request for an injection). This is a partial adherence to the broader context of an HPI and misses multiple important details compared to the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note perfectly adhered to its instruction 'Must be extract what doctor has dictated, Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.' and accurately extracted the musculoskeletal exam findings exactly as dictated in the transcript. The benchmark note, conversely, introduced minor rephrasing and corrections not present in the original dictation (e.g., changing 'walking' to 'locking', adding 'intact' and 'ecchymosis', omitting 'tacky' and 'Acute'). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate note 'X-rays are three views of the finger are normal.' is a perfect verbatim match to the transcript. The benchmark added 'left index' which, while clinically appropriate, was not explicitly dictated. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The first assessment item 'Left index finger triggering with A1 pulley involvement' is clinically sound and consistent with the transcript. However, the second item 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' is a complete hallucination (no mention of right upper extremity in transcript) and directly contradicts the candidate's own instruction to 'Do not include normal findings such as “skin is intact”. The conflicting internal instruction led to a major error. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate correctly identified that the patient is not having the injection and the X-ray results. 'Plan is to proceed with trigger point management' is a reasonable interpretation of 'plan trigger'. However, 'Patient was educated on the condition and treatment plan' is an inference not explicitly stated in the transcript. Crucially, 'Follow-up in 6 to 8 weeks' is a major hallucination with no mention of any follow-up time in the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 18

**Percentage:** 51.42857142857143

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in fields requiring verbatim extraction or direct factual recall, often outperforming the benchmark in adherence to verbatim instructions (e.g., MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM, IMAGING_RESULTS). However, it struggles significantly with fields requiring synthesis or interpretation according to standard clinical note practices (HPI, Assessment, Plan), largely due to rigid adherence to overly specific or conflicting internal instructions, leading to critical omissions and factual hallucinations (e.g., missing key HPI details, hallucinating a right upper extremity skin finding, and fabricating a follow-up time).

| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | The benchmark specifies '-' for the patient name, while the candidate correctly identified 'Spencer' from the transcript based on its instructions. However, adhering strictly to the benchmark as the ground truth, this constitutes a major content difference from the expected value of '-'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate's output 'Left small finger locking and catching' perfectly matches the benchmark and is accurately extracted from the transcript, adhering to all instructions. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate strictly followed its internal instruction to only provide onset, duration, location, and severity. While accurate within those limits, it missed multiple significant details present in the benchmark, such as the patient's delay in seeking care, desire for treatment, and impact on his job as a designer. This constitutes multiple missing details compared to the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate aimed for verbatim extraction as per its instruction, which resulted in phrases like 'In fact, without erythema' and 'aim of fluid is nodule that is triggering'. The benchmark, however, contained clinically refined phrases like 'No erythema' and 'A1 pulley. Nodule palpable.'. While the candidate was more verbatim to the raw audio, it did not match the benchmark's content, which serves as the ground truth for this evaluation. The difference in anatomical reference ('aim of fluid' vs 'A1 pulley') is a significant factual discrepancy when comparing to the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate provided 'X-rays are normal'. The benchmark provided 'X-rays of the left small finger are normal.'. The candidate's response is accurate and from the transcript, with the benchmark adding a relevant contextual detail. This is considered a minor wording difference with meaning preserved. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | While the core diagnosis 'Left small finger trigger finger with nodule' is correct, the candidate included 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.'. This directly contradicts the primary instruction 'Do not include normal findings' in the candidate's own prompt for this field, even though a conflicting instruction later suggested to include them. The benchmark correctly omits these normal findings, making the candidate's entry bloated and partially incorrect for an assessment section. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate correctly identified the 'trigger finger release'. However, it included several additional details not present in the benchmark or explicitly stated for this patient in the transcript (e.g., 'Discussed the procedure and expected recovery timeline.', 'Patient is advised to avoid repetitive gripping and heavy use'). The follow-up time also differed significantly ('6 to 8 weeks' vs benchmark's '2 weeks'), with both times being inferred or attributed incorrectly to this patient from the transcript. This indicates multiple instances of added, unverified details, bordering on minor hallucination. |

**Total Score:** 17

**Percentage:** 48.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in extracting straightforward information like the chief complaint and general imaging results. However, its overall performance was significantly hampered by inconsistent adherence to benchmark content, often due to conflicting or overly restrictive internal instructions that limited information or prompted the inclusion of irrelevant details. Specifically, the HPI was too brief, the musculoskeletal exam diverged from the benchmark's corrected phrasing, the assessment included inappropriate normal findings, and the plan contained several unverified inferences/hallucinations for the specific patient. The patient name discrepancy highlighted a conflict between the benchmark's format and the candidate's explicit instruction.

| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The transcript does not contain the patient's name. The candidate provided 'She', which is not a name and completely incorrect for this field. The benchmark provides 'Susan Shell', which is also not in the transcript, but the candidate's output is still an incorrect patient name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The benchmark provides 'Wrist pain', which is concise. The candidate adds 'Right' and 'limiting daily activities' which, while true from the transcript, are considered additional details or context beyond a simple chief complaint, violating the instruction to provide 'only the patient's chief complaint without any additional details or context'. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's HPI only describes onset, duration, location, and severity of wrist pain, completely missing the broader context and details present in the benchmark's comprehensive HPI narrative. The benchmark includes crucial information about knee replacement, synovitis, osteoporosis, and the overall reason for the visit, which the candidate omits entirely. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The benchmark for this field is '-', indicating no relevant musculoskeletal findings should be documented. The candidate provides a verbatim quote from the doctor related to exam findings ('Exam mostly unchanged, except you can delete the large, poorly defined nodule.'). While the content is verbatim from the transcript, it contradicts the benchmark's expectation for this field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate's content 'The imaging you can leave all the same.' is a verbatim extract from the transcript. The benchmark simplifies this to 'Imaging mostly unchanged'. The meaning is preserved, but there's a minor wording difference compared to the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The benchmark lists 'Bilateral wrist arthritis' and 'Synovitis'. The candidate includes these (with 'Improved synovitis' which is more precise to transcript) but also adds 'Right wrist pain with significant functional limitation', 'Right knee replacement status post', and 'Osteoporosis on infusion therapy'. While these added items are factually present in the transcript, they are not included in the benchmark's concise assessment, leading to a significant content mismatch from the ground truth. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate hallucinates a specific follow-up time ('6 to 8 weeks') that is not present in the provided transcript. It also includes the osteoporosis infusion therapy in the plan which the benchmark does not, and misses the 'Plan OR Risks' phrase that is in the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 13

**Percentage:** 37.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note struggled significantly in matching the content and scope of the benchmark note, especially in the HPI and Assessment sections, where it either missed substantial details or included information that diverged from the benchmark's concise nature. It also exhibited hallucination by adding a follow-up time not present in the transcript. While it showed good verbatim extraction for the 'Imaging Results' and some factual accuracy in 'Chief Complaint', these were often presented with extra details or in a format that did not align with the benchmark or its own instructions for conciseness. The 'Patient Name' field was completely incorrect.

| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The patient's name is not mentioned in the transcript. While the candidate correctly identifies this by returning an empty list, the benchmark note includes 'Sandra Herrara' as the ground truth. Therefore, the candidate fails to match the benchmark's content. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | The chief complaint 'Follow up for hand pain' is an inference made in the benchmark note, based on the context of the patient's symptoms (previous injection offering no relief). The candidate returns an empty list, failing to infer or capture this implied chief complaint present in the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The benchmark accurately extracts the patient's reported history of present illness: 'She reports previous injection did not offer any relief. She wants to know what is going on.' from the transcript. The candidate's HPI_SPENCER field is empty, completely missing this relevant information. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate's output is largely verbatim from the transcript, adhering to its instruction 'Must be extract what doctor has dictated, Do not change/modify any thing. must be verbatim.' However, the benchmark note corrects misspoken terms (e.g., 'CMC during' to 'carpometacarpal joint', 'finger stain' to 'Finkelstein') and parses the information into distinct points, providing a clinically accurate and properly formatted representation. The candidate's verbatim approach leads to factual inaccuracies (e.g., 'finger stain' instead of 'Finkelstein') and lacks the refined structure of the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Neither the transcript nor the notes indicate any imaging results. Both the benchmark ('-') and candidate (`[]`) correctly reflect this, indicating a perfect match in factual content. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's assessment includes 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.', which contradict the exam findings in the transcript (hypopigmentation, positive Finkelstein/Grind implies findings/tenderness) and also a negative rule in its own instructions ('Do not include normal findings'). While the inferred diagnosis 'Right first dorsal compartment tendinopathy' is plausible, the preceding incorrect statements make the overall entry mostly incorrect and it does not match the benchmark's concise 'Pain in hand'. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate accurately extracted most of the plan items, including 'Previous injection offered no relief.' and 'Return to clinic in six weeks for follow-up.' However, it transcribed 'dig verban's injection' verbatim. The benchmark correctly transcribed this as the proper medical term 'de Quervain's injection.' This is a minor but notable factual inaccuracy in medical terminology compared to the corrected benchmark, which a medical scribe would typically address. |

**Total Score:** 12

**Percentage:** 34.28571428571429

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated significant weaknesses in accurately capturing and processing key clinical information. It frequently missed essential details present or implied in the benchmark (Patient Name, Chief Complaint, HPI) and struggled with clinical inference and correction of misspoken terms, especially evident in the Musculoskeletal and Plan sections. Furthermore, the Assessment field showed a failure to adhere to its own instructions and included hallucinated normal findings. While it correctly identified the absence of imaging, the overall performance was poor due to content omissions, factual inaccuracies compared to the human-corrected benchmark, and a lack of 'scribe-style' refinement expected in clinical notes.

| PATIENT_NAME | 2 | While 'Stephanie Humphrey' is correctly identified, the candidate note includes names of three other patients (Terrance Rodski, Amit Jaini, David Schechter) who are not relevant to this specific clinical note, which is focused on Stephanie Humphrey as per the benchmark. This dilutes the accuracy for a single-patient note. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | The chief complaint for Stephanie Humphrey ('Left wrist pain') is accurate. However, the candidate note includes chief complaints for three other patients, which are extraneous and irrelevant to the scope of this single-patient note, similar to the PATIENT_NAME issue. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The HPI for Stephanie Humphrey (first entry) accurately extracts the Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity, adhering perfectly to the specific instruction for this field ('only mention that, and nothing else'). However, the note includes HPIs for two other patients, making it deviate significantly from a single patient's clinical note, thus preventing a higher score. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | The candidate note correctly extracts the verbatim musculoskeletal findings for Stephanie Humphrey from the transcript, which the benchmark incorrectly marked as empty. So, the candidate's content for Stephanie is factually correct and verbatim according to the transcript and instructions. However, it includes verbatim exams for two other patients, which are irrelevant for a single patient note, leading to a deduction. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | The imaging results for Stephanie Humphrey ('X-rays of the left wrist show no fractures, normal alignment') are mostly accurate but slightly less detailed than the benchmark (e.g., missing specific mention of 'urgent care' X-rays). Crucially, the candidate also includes imaging results for two other patients, significantly impacting the relevance for a single-patient note. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | The assessment for Stephanie Humphrey ('Left ECU tendonitis with ulnar-sided wrist pain,' 'Right upper extremity skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.') correctly identifies her conditions and follows the specific, sometimes conflicting, instructions (Rule 7) for including 'normal findings' as per the benchmark. However, assessments for other patients are included, which is extraneous and lowers the score. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The plan for Stephanie Humphrey is comprehensive, accurate, and aligns well with the benchmark, even adding relevant diagnostic context as per the field's instruction. Despite the high quality of content for Stephanie, the candidate includes plans for three other patients and additional administrative instructions not related to Stephanie's plan, which is a major deviation from a single-patient note. |

**Total Score:** 18

**Percentage:** 51.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates a strong ability to extract and format specific clinical details for individual fields, often adhering closely to the detailed instructions provided for each section. For the patient Stephanie Humphrey, the content extracted was largely accurate and well-structured, and in some cases, more complete or precise than the benchmark (e.g., Musculoskeletal Verbatim). However, the primary and consistent weakness across almost all fields is the failure to constrain the output to a single patient. The note includes information for all patients mentioned in the transcript, which significantly detracts from its quality and utility as a focused clinical record for a single individual as implied by the benchmark's structure. This led to penalties despite the strong performance on content extraction for the relevant patient.

| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The candidate completely failed to extract the patient's name, returning a pronoun ('She') instead of the actual name ('Susan Oakes') as provided in the benchmark note. The benchmark is considered the ground truth for this field. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The candidate accurately identifies symptoms (achiness, limited motion, electric sensation) but misses the primary context of 'Follow-up' which is present in the benchmark and implied by the doctor's initial statement. The candidate's entry includes more detail than typically expected for a concise chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate attempted to follow its instruction to provide Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity (ODLS) format. However, the benchmark note provides a detailed narrative HPI that directly reflects the transcript and includes significant contextual information (e.g., patient doing okay overall, life being difficult, nerve studies, asking about results) that the candidate's ODLS format entirely omits. The candidate's content significantly deviates from the factual completeness of the benchmark's narrative HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The candidate extracted 'Exam is unchanged' verbatim from the transcript, which adheres to its instruction. However, the benchmark note, which serves as the ground truth, explicitly lists '-' for this field. This indicates that the benchmark determined no specific musculoskeletal findings were to be recorded here, thus the candidate's content does not match the benchmark's intended output for this specific field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | The candidate provides detailed nerve study results as dictated in the transcript, which are factually accurate. However, the benchmark note provides a general summary 'Nerve study results'. While the candidate's output is more informative regarding the actual findings, it does not match the specific concise content chosen by the benchmark for this field. This is a significant difference in content detail. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate successfully included all key items that the benchmark's `history.data` indicated as intended content for the Assessment section. Furthermore, it accurately added other clinically relevant diagnoses/assessments from the transcript (no evidence of carpal tunnel, possible ulnar nerve compression, cervical radiculopathy under evaluation) that enhance the completeness of the assessment without being incorrect. The candidate also correctly followed the (contradictory) instruction to include 'skin is intact' and 'no tenderness to palpation', matching the benchmark's inclusion of these. Minor formatting differences exist, but the meaning is preserved and enhanced. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate's plan section is an excellent and comprehensive summary of the dictated plan. It accurately captures all key elements from the transcript, closely matching or rephrasing the benchmark's content. Notably, the candidate corrected a factual inaccuracy present in the benchmark ('neurology' vs. 'urology' consult as dictated in the transcript), demonstrating superior fidelity to the source audio. The formatting and conversational tone adhere well to the instructions. |

**Total Score:** 16

**Percentage:** 45.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated significant variability in its performance across different fields. It struggled notably with fields requiring extraction of specific patient identifying information (PATIENT_NAME) and adhering to the benchmark's specific content choices or narrative style for HPI and Musculoskeletal findings. For Imaging Results, it provided factually correct but more detailed content than the benchmark's concise entry. However, the candidate performed strongly in complex sections like Assessment and excelled in the Plan section, providing a comprehensive and accurate summary that even corrected a minor factual error found in the benchmark, showcasing its ability to synthesize and structure clinical information effectively when instructions are aligned with its capabilities.

| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note strictly adheres to its internal instruction to only provide Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity. While these specific details are accurate, this narrow instruction leads to a significant amount of the HPI content present in the benchmark note being omitted (e.g., fluctuation of masses, seeing rheumatologist, prior imaging), resulting in multiple missing factual details compared to the benchmark's comprehensive HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The benchmark note explicitly lists '-' for this field, indicating no relevant musculoskeletal findings should be extracted for the note. The candidate, however, includes a detailed verbatim section of the musculoskeletal exam. This is a complete factual mismatch with the benchmark's ground truth for this specific field, despite the content being present in the transcript and the candidate following its instruction to extract verbatim. The benchmark implies this information should not be in this section. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The content is almost identical to the benchmark, with only minor wording/tense differences ('show' vs 'showed', 'demonstrates' vs 'demonstrated', 'noted at' vs 'at') that do not alter the factual meaning. |

However, it completely misses 'Bilateral hand pain,' which is present in the benchmark and mentioned in the transcript as a diagnosis. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate note captures the main elements of the plan. However, it includes additional contextual sentences not present in the benchmark, slightly deviates in wording ('or' vs 'versus'), and fails to adhere to the instruction to 'User numbers instead of word where necessary' by writing 'six weeks' instead of '6 weeks'. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strong accuracy in extracting the patient's name and imaging results with only minor deviations. However, its performance was significantly impacted by its handling of the 'HPI_SPENCER' and 'MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM' fields. For HPI, while it adhered to its internal instruction for specific attributes (onset, duration, etc.), it omitted substantial narrative content present in the benchmark, leading to a fragmented HPI. For Musculoskeletal, despite correctly extracting verbatim content from the transcript as per its instruction, it completely contradicted the benchmark, which indicated no content for this field, resulting in a hallucination relative to the established ground truth. In 'Assessment' and 'Plan', the candidate missed some key details and exhibited minor formatting/wording inconsistencies and adherence issues with specific instructions (e.g., numerical formatting), respectively.

| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note strictly adheres to its own restrictive instruction to only include Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity. However, when compared to the benchmark, it misses a significant amount of critical historical information and context that is typically part of a comprehensive HPI, such as previous treatments, physician names, and changes in the masses. This constitutes multiple missing details compared to the ground truth benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The candidate note provided verbatim musculoskeletal exam findings as instructed by its internal rules, and these findings are present in the transcript. However, the benchmark note for this field is explicitly '-', indicating no content. As the evaluation requires comparing the candidate against the benchmark (ground truth), the presence of any content in the candidate note constitutes a major content difference from the benchmark's expectation for this field. Therefore, despite the content being factually correct based on the transcript, its inclusion here deviates significantly from the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The imaging results are accurately extracted. There are minor wording differences such as 'show' vs 'showed', 'noted at' vs 'at', and slight phrasing variations ('MCP joint of the thumb' vs 'thumb MCP joint'), but the factual content and meaning are perfectly preserved. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate note correctly identified some diagnoses but made two notable errors compared to the benchmark: 1) It used 'osteophytes' for 'Bilateral thumb and MCP joint' instead of 'masses' as in the benchmark, which is a factual inaccuracy given the context of fluctuating 'masses' in the transcript. 2) It missed including 'No tenderness to palpation', despite this being explicitly mentioned in the transcript and included in the benchmark, and despite the candidate's own instruction specifically guiding it to include this if applicable. This demonstrates missing and incorrect minor details, resulting in partial adherence to instructions. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate note captures most elements of the plan but has some discrepancies. It attributes 'night splints' to 'carpal tunnel' while the benchmark links it to 'the masses', which is a plausible but different interpretation from the transcript. It also adds 'if symptoms progress' to the aspiration/biopsy recommendation, which was not explicitly stated in the doctor's plan, making it an interpretation rather than a direct reflection. While it adds a useful detail ('not currently bothersome') that is present in the transcript and aligns with its own instruction, the other deviations are significant enough to reduce the score. |

**Total Score:** 23

**Percentage:** 65.71

**Overall Summary:** The AI-generated note performs well in extracting patient demographic information and chief complaint, achieving perfect scores in these concise fields. The Imaging Results section is also strong, with only minor wording variations. However, the note struggles significantly in more complex fields like HPI, Musculoskeletal Verbatim, and Assessment. The HPI is overly simplistic compared to the benchmark, missing crucial historical context. The Musculoskeletal Verbatim section is a direct mismatch with the benchmark, highlighting a conflict between the candidate's adherence to its internal instructions (to extract verbatim exam findings) and the benchmark's empty field, which indicates a discrepancy in field purpose. The Assessment and Plan sections contain incorrect details, missing information, or unstated interpretations, demonstrating a partial failure to accurately capture the full clinical context and adhere to benchmark expectations. Overall, the note's performance is moderate, excelling in direct extraction but falling short in comprehensive clinical summarization and precise adherence to the full scope of benchmark content.

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in extracting straightforward information like patient name, chief complaint, and assessment findings. It correctly identifies the absence of musculoskeletal exam details. However, significant weaknesses are observed in fields requiring contextual understanding and strict adherence to factual extraction. The model hallucinates unstated details in the HPI based on an overly specific instruction and incorrectly attributes imaging results pertaining to another patient. The plan section, while largely accurate in content, introduces a follow-up time not present in the transcript and differing from the benchmark, highlighting a potential over-reliance on instructional examples when actual information is absent.

| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate's output for this field is highly accurate and adheres perfectly to the 'verbatim' instruction. It correctly captures all dictated details, including 'for patient', unlike the benchmark which slightly modified it. Minor capitalization difference ('pin' vs 'Pin') does not detract from verbatim accuracy. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate perfectly matched the benchmark and the transcript for imaging results. It is factually accurate and complete. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | The instruction for this field is contradictory regarding 'normal findings'. The candidate, like the benchmark, included 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.', which follows the latter part of the instruction. However, the candidate additionally included 'Stiff fingers.', which is an exam finding and not typically part of the 'Assessment' list of conditions/issues, and explicitly contradicted by the instruction 'Do not include any exam findings'. The benchmark did not include 'Stiff fingers'. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate provided a comprehensive and highly accurate plan that captures all details from the transcript, including the specifics of the 10-day follow-up ('Likely pin removal or repeat X-rays') which the benchmark omitted. The phrasing is appropriate for a scribe note, and the information is well-organized in a list format. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed strongly in fields requiring verbatim extraction (Musculoskeletal, Imaging) and demonstrated excellent comprehension in detailing the Plan, often being more comprehensive than the benchmark. However, it struggled significantly with the Chief Complaint, misinterpreting the patient's statement, and hallucinated details in the HPI due to a problematic instruction not aligned with transcript content. The Assessment field showed minor deviation by including an exam finding not present in the benchmark, despite contradictory instructions for normal findings.

# REC-6632

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Perfect match to the benchmark and correctly extracts only the patient's name as per instructions. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The benchmark includes 'Forearm pain, thumb pain', while the candidate only listed 'Thumb pain'. The transcript explicitly mentions 'her forearm pain is better' in addition to 'her thumb pain is killing her', indicating both were part of the chief complaint. Missing the forearm pain component is a factual omission. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's HPI content deviates significantly from the benchmark. While it followed its own highly restrictive instructions (Onset, Duration, Location, Severity), these instructions resulted in a note that misses critical contextual details present in the benchmark and transcript, such as forearm pain being better, the patient's specific question about alleviating pain, the daughter's wedding, and the impact of reduced hand use on pain. It also inferred 'Onset: Recent' and 'Duration: Ongoing' which were not explicitly stated. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | The candidate accurately transcribed most of the musculoskeletal findings verbatim. However, it omitted 'Right upper extremity' which was present in the benchmark and the doctor's dictation. Given the 'must be verbatim' instruction, this is a minor deviation. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | The benchmark states 'X-rays reviewed. It shows planned arthritis.' which is directly from the transcript ('It'll be planned arthritis'). The candidate provided 'X-rays reviewed. Mild to moderate degenerative changes consistent with trapeziometacarpal joint arthritis.' This is an interpretation/elaboration not explicitly dictated, adding details not in the source. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's assessment includes 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.', which explicitly contradict its primary instruction to 'Do not include normal findings'. While the instruction later provides contradictory examples, following the core rule of an assessment (active conditions only) makes these inclusions incorrect and deviates significantly from the concise benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate's plan is comprehensive and accurately reflects all points from the benchmark and the transcript. It also adds clinically appropriate specificity (e.g., 'into the right trapeziometacarpal joint', 'for follow-up if symptoms persist') without hallucinating, and adheres to the requested format. |

**Total Score:** 22

**Percentage:** 62.85714285714286

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in accurately capturing the patient's name and the comprehensive treatment plan, achieving perfect scores in these areas. However, it struggled significantly with fields where the instructions were either overly restrictive (HPI_SPENCER) leading to a lack of crucial contextual information, or contradictory (ASSESSMENT_SPENCER) leading to the inclusion of irrelevant details that violated core rules. Minor omissions were noted in the musculoskeletal exam, and the imaging results included an interpretation not explicitly dictated, impacting factual accuracy. The note's adherence to its own complex and sometimes conflicting instructions impacted its overall factual completeness and clinical relevance compared to the benchmark.

# REC-6635

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The candidate provided 'Spencer' as the patient's name, which is incorrect. The benchmark note specifies 'Jedediah Voltz', and 'Spencer' appears to be an internal field name from the prompt, not the patient's actual name from the transcript or benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate's chief complaint 'Index finger pain and stiffness' perfectly matches the benchmark note and is accurately extracted from the transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | While the candidate accurately extracted the 'Onset', 'Location', and 'Severity' based on its specific instructions, it completely missed significant portions of the HPI narrative present in both the transcript and the benchmark, such as the patient's profession, the full mechanism of injury, details about the urgent care visit, suture removal, and the wound re-opening. This represents multiple missing details compared to the benchmark's comprehensive HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | The candidate's output for musculoskeletal exam is almost verbatim from the transcript ('Left upper extremity in- a laceration well-healing, um, without sutures. A very stiff index finger PIP able to flex only about 10 degrees actively at this time. Moderate soft tissue swelling, no sensory tenderness to palpation. Excellent range of motion of the remaining digit.'). The benchmark is slightly rephrased and formatted as a list, but the factual content and meaning are perfectly preserved. The candidate followed its 'verbatim' instruction very well. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate's 'X-rays are normal' is a perfect match to the benchmark and the doctor's statement in the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate included several exam findings ('Moderate soft tissue swelling', 'No sensory tenderness to palpation', 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact') in the assessment, which are not typically part of the 'Assessment' section (diagnoses/problems). The benchmark correctly lists only the primary issues ('Laceration of the left index finger', 'Stiff left index finger'). Although the candidate's instructions for this field were contradictory regarding normal findings, its output deviates significantly from standard assessment content and the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate's plan is concise, accurate, and clearly written. It covers the essential components of the plan (hand therapy, follow-up appointment with time and purpose) as dictated, and even slightly improves upon the benchmark's fragmented first point ('Plan proximal interphalangeal') by integrating it into a clear recommendation. |

**Total Score:** 22

**Percentage:** 62.857142857142854

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in fields like Chief Complaint, Imaging Results, and Plan, accurately capturing and structuring the information. Its verbatim extraction for Musculoskeletal exam was also highly accurate. However, its overall score was significantly impacted by critical failures in the Patient Name field (completely incorrect) and the Assessment field (incorrectly including exam findings). The HPI section, while adhering to the candidate's own restrictive instructions, missed substantial narrative and contextual details present in the benchmark and transcript, leading to a less comprehensive output.

# REC-6639

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 3 | The candidate correctly identified 'Chaz Thomas' but included a list of all patients mentioned in the transcript, which deviates from the benchmark's scope of providing only the current patient's name for this specific note. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The candidate added 'for laceration repair' to the chief complaint, which provides additional context. The benchmark provided simply 'Follow-up', and the instruction for this field was to provide 'only the patient's chief complaint without any additional details or context'. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's HPI content and format ('Onset:..., Duration:..., Location:..., Severity:...') are completely different from the benchmark's narrative HPI. The candidate also included details (like severity) that were derived from the physical exam rather than the patient's chief complaint/HPI as presented in the transcript and benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | The candidate provided a more complete verbatim extraction of the musculoskeletal exam findings from the transcript compared to the benchmark ('Sutures removed today, patient tolerating well without apparent complication'). While more comprehensive and adhering better to the 'verbatim' instruction, it is not an exact match to the benchmark's content, which is considered the ground truth. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The candidate completely hallucinated imaging results for Chaz Thomas by including results that belong to a different patient (Josefina Marcial) from the transcript. The benchmark correctly indicated no imaging ('-') for this patient. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's assessment ('Right hand laceration status post suture removal with residual pain and limited flexion') is a problem-focused summary. However, the benchmark's content for Assessment ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.') consists of normal exam findings. This is a major factual and interpretative difference from the ground truth. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate correctly identified most plan items but incorrectly included a past action ('Sutures removed today') in the plan, which is not a future recommendation. While it provided more detail for the follow-up, the inclusion of a completed action makes it a less accurate representation of the 'Plan' section compared to the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 15

**Percentage:** 42.857142857142854

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated significant issues with maintaining patient context, leading to factual errors like hallucinating imaging results for the wrong patient. Its interpretation and formatting of certain fields (HPI, Assessment) also deviated substantially from the benchmark's content, despite conflicting instructions within its own JSON structure. While it showed a good ability to extract verbatim information for musculoskeletal findings, the overall performance was hampered by inaccuracies and a failure to align with the benchmark's established ground truth and scope for this specific patient's note.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name is perfectly matched and adheres to instructions. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The candidate missed a key chief complaint, 'Follow up for hand surgery', and added 'worsening over time' which is more of a detail than a concise chief complaint for a follow-up visit, going against the instruction to avoid additional details or context. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate completely hallucinated the HPI for Kathy Smith, providing an 'Onset, duration, location, severity' description that belongs to a different patient from the transcript, rather than the actual follow-up context for Kathy Smith. This is entirely incorrect. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | While a portion of the musculoskeletal exam for Kathy Smith is correctly extracted verbatim, the candidate includes a significant amount of irrelevant and factually incorrect information from another patient's exam, which is a major error in attribution and content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The candidate completely fabricated imaging results for Kathy Smith. No imaging was mentioned for her in the transcript; the provided details belong to a different patient. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate incorrectly listed conditions belonging to other patients ('Bilateral thumb CMC arthritis', 'Progressive DIP joint arthritis', 'Right small finger DIP joint ankylosis') as Kathy Smith's assessment. It also included exam findings and 'normal' findings ('Skin is intact', 'No tenderness to palpation') despite instructions to exclude them (though the instruction was contradictory for normal findings, the primary intent is clear). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate correctly identified the core plan elements (continue therapy, return to Jack, return in 6 weeks) but padded the section with irrelevant details like reassessments and patient reports that belong in the HPI or objective exam, not the plan of action, diluting the quality of the section. |

**Total Score:** 11

**Percentage:** 31.42857142857143

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed poorly, primarily due to significant factual inaccuracies stemming from misattributing information from other patients discussed in the transcript to Kathy Smith. This was evident in the HPI, Musculoskeletal exam, Imaging Results, and Assessment sections, where large portions of the content were irrelevant or incorrect for the patient. While the Patient Name was perfect, and core elements of the Chief Complaint and Plan were accurate, the pervasive errors in key clinical sections severely impacted the overall quality and reliability of the note. The model struggled to isolate information pertinent to a single patient when multiple patient encounters were present in the transcript and also failed to consistently adhere to instructions (e.g., excluding normal findings or not including exam details in the plan).

| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate's HPI format (Onset, Duration, Location, Severity) deviated from the benchmark's narrative style. More critically, it omitted key factual details from the transcript and benchmark, specifically the patient's denial of numbness and tingling, while including an interpretive 'gradual' onset not explicitly stated. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The benchmark note explicitly shows '-' (empty) for this field, indicating no content is expected. The candidate note, despite having an instruction for verbatim extraction, provided detailed content. While the extracted content is factually present in the transcript, its presence in this field constitutes a major content difference from the benchmark's expected empty state. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | The candidate note contained factual inaccuracies and significant deviations in content. It misidentified 'neovasculitis' as 'narrowing' and provided a verbatim quote of an edit instruction ('except you can delete the "calcific arteriogram is noted"') instead of summarizing the actual findings for the left hand, as seen in the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate captured the main conditions (CMC arthritis, cubital/carpal tunnel) and correctly noted the progression of CMC arthritis. It included 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' which matches the benchmark, despite paradoxical instructions within the candidate's own prompt. However, it hallucinated 'No tenderness to palpation', which was not stated in the transcript or present in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | The candidate accurately captured all the key elements of the plan, including injections, discussion about steroids, observation for carpal/cubital tunnel, consideration of nerve studies, and follow-up. There are minor wording differences (e.g., 'nerve conduction studies' vs 'nerve studies', 'agrees to the treatment plan' vs 'understands we would do this today') but the meaning and completeness are well-preserved. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed well on straightforward information extraction for patient demographics and chief complaint. However, it struggled significantly with more complex fields like HPI and Imaging Results, demonstrating factual inaccuracies and an inability to correctly summarize or interpret medical information as per the benchmark. The 'MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM' field was incorrectly populated against the benchmark's empty expectation. The Assessment and Plan sections showed moderate performance, with some minor over-inclusions/hallucinations in Assessment, but generally strong coherence in the Plan section.

# REC-6644

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The benchmark note is for 'Cathy Smith'. While 'Cathy Smith' is listed, the candidate note erroneously includes two other patient names ('Brigitte Metman', 'Samar Actrion') from the transcript, demonstrating a failure to scope the note to the specific patient. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 0 | The benchmark's chief complaint for Cathy Smith is 'Follow up hand pain and swelling'. The candidate note lists chief complaints for other patients from the transcript ('Increasing pain and deformity in fingers', 'Burning pain from mid-palm to mid-forearm', 'Progressively worsening bilateral hand pain') none of which are correct for Cathy Smith. This field is completely incorrect. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The benchmark provides Cathy Smith's HPI as a follow-up. The candidate note instead extracts HPI details (Onset, duration, location, severity) for the first patient mentioned in the transcript (regarding DIP joint arthritis), not Cathy Smith. This is completely irrelevant to Cathy Smith's visit. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The candidate note includes the correct verbatim musculoskeletal findings for Cathy Smith. However, it also includes extensive verbatim findings for two other patients discussed in the transcript, making the output significantly diluted with irrelevant information and failing to scope to the correct patient. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The benchmark correctly indicates no imaging results for Cathy Smith's current visit ('-'). The candidate note includes imaging results for the first patient mentioned in the transcript and also for Brigitte Metman ('X-rays are normal'), neither of which are relevant to Cathy Smith's visit. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate correctly identifies 'Persistent post-surgical tenderness and scarring at A1 pulley site' for Cathy Smith, which is relevant. However, it includes numerous assessment items for the other two patients discussed in the transcript and violates the instruction 'Do not include normal findings' by including 'Right upper extremity skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation'. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate correctly includes Cathy Smith's plan items ('Continue hand therapy... transition of care to Jack is approved.', 'Return to clinic in six weeks for follow-up.'). However, similar to other fields, it severely dilutes this information by including the full plans for the other two patients mentioned in the transcript. This represents a major content difference due to the vast amount of irrelevant information. |

**Total Score:** 3

**Percentage:** 8.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed poorly across all fields primarily due to a fundamental failure to scope the generated content to the specific patient (Cathy Smith) represented in the benchmark note. Instead of focusing on Cathy Smith, the model extracted and combined information from all three patient encounters mentioned in the transcript. While some verbatim information for Cathy Smith was correctly extracted in the 'MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM' and 'PLAN_SPENCER_' fields, it was heavily diluted by irrelevant data from other patients. The 'PATIENT_NAME', 'CHIEF_COMPLAINT', 'HPI_SPENCER', and 'IMAGING_RESULTS' fields were largely or entirely incorrect for the target patient. This indicates a significant issue with context awareness and patient isolation.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The candidate note perfectly matched the patient's name as provided in the benchmark note and transcript, adhering to the instruction. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate note accurately identified 'Bilateral thumb pain' as the chief complaint, matching the benchmark and following the instruction to provide only the complaint without additional context. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate followed its instruction to extract Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity, which is a different format than the narrative benchmark. While it correctly identified most of these details, it missed the important HPI detail 'He is not having any numbness and tingling' which was present in the benchmark and transcript. This constitutes missing a minor detail. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The instruction for this field was to extract 'physical examination finding' verbatim. While the candidate did extract the initial physical exam findings verbatim, it incorrectly included subsequent X-ray findings. X-ray results are not physical examination findings, leading to a significant categorical error for this field, despite being verbatim from the transcript's dictated flow. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | The candidate note contained multiple inaccuracies compared to the benchmark and transcript. It missed 'three views' for the right hand X-ray, incorrectly changed 'neovasculitis with metacarpal' to 'narrowing', and misrepresented the 'calcific arteriogram' findings by implying its absence for both hands, whereas it was noted for the right hand in the transcript and benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate correctly identified the primary medical conditions. However, it hallucinated 'No tenderness to palpation', which was neither mentioned in the transcript nor implicitly derived. While it included 'Right upper extremity skin is intact' based on a conflicting internal instruction, the hallucination is a significant error. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | The candidate accurately captured most of the key plan points, including injections, discussion of steroid nature/rebound pain, observation for carpal/cubital tunnel, and consideration of nerve studies. It followed its instruction to use '6 to 8 weeks' for follow-up, despite the transcript saying '2 months'. There was minor redundancy in the injection points and a minor unstated addition ('Patient advised to monitor symptoms'). |

**Total Score:** 23

**Percentage:** 65.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in extracting straightforward information such as patient name and chief complaint. However, its performance significantly declined in fields requiring nuanced content filtering, strict adherence to field scope, or accurate interpretation of complex medical details. The model struggled with distinguishing physical exam findings from imaging results (Musculoskeletal field), introduced factual inaccuracies/hallucinations (Imaging Results, Assessment), and sometimes prioritized its own formatting instructions over comprehensive factual content from the transcript (HPI). While it captured the essence of the plan, minor additions and redundancies were noted.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name 'N. Kalinski' is accurately extracted and perfectly matches the benchmark note. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate note includes 'Recurrence of' in the chief complaint, which is factually accurate but makes the Chief Complaint slightly less concise than the benchmark's 'Left middle finger trigger finger'. The core meaning is preserved. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate note adhered to its internal instruction to only provide Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity. However, this instruction severely limited the content, leading to the omission of crucial historical details (previous injection date) and contextual information (current recurrence, future follow-up) that are essential components of a comprehensive HPI as present in the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The transcript did not contain any new dictated musculoskeletal exam findings. The candidate correctly returned an empty array, adhering perfectly to the instruction 'If not information is found, please return empty.' |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The doctor explicitly stated, 'We can remove the imaging review for the plan.' The candidate accurately captured this as 'No imaging review performed,' which is a perfect factual representation and more explicit than the benchmark's '-'. The key name difference (IMAGING_RESULTS vs IMAGING_GEORGE) is noted but not penalized as the content is being evaluated. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | While 'Recurrence of left middle finger trigger finger' is an acceptable assessment, the candidate hallucinated 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' This finding was not dictated by the doctor in the transcript. Furthermore, its inclusion directly violates the candidate's own instruction 'Do not include normal findings such as “skin is intact”.' This is a major factual error and a self-contradiction. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate incorrectly included historical HPI/assessment details ('Patient underwent left middle finger trigger finger injection on 10-22-24.', 'He has had recurrence of symptoms.') in the plan section. Critically, it hallucinated the follow-up time '6 to 8 weeks'; the doctor only stated 'He will return to clinic if he has any recurrence.' This constitutes major content differences and a significant hallucination. |

**Total Score:** 23

**Percentage:** 65.71428571428571

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated accuracy in extracting patient demographics and correctly identifying absent information for musculoskeletal exam and imaging. However, it exhibited significant weaknesses in clinical content fields, particularly HPI, Assessment, and Plan. The HPI was overly restricted by its internal instruction, leading to critical omissions. The Assessment and Plan sections suffered from hallucinations (e.g., 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' and '6 to 8 weeks' follow-up) and included details that were out of scope for the respective sections (e.g., historical HPI in the Plan). The note struggled with distinguishing between different sections of a clinical note and maintaining factual accuracy based solely on the transcript, especially when its own instructions were contradictory or overly restrictive.
