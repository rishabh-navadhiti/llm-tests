    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The benchmark specifies '-' for the patient name, while the candidate correctly identified 'Spencer' from the transcript based on its instructions. However, adhering strictly to the benchmark as the ground truth, this constitutes a major content difference from the expected value of '-'."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate's output 'Left small finger locking and catching' perfectly matches the benchmark and is accurately extracted from the transcript, adhering to all instructions."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate strictly followed its internal instruction to only provide onset, duration, location, and severity. While accurate within those limits, it missed multiple significant details present in the benchmark, such as the patient's delay in seeking care, desire for treatment, and impact on his job as a designer. This constitutes multiple missing details compared to the benchmark."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate aimed for verbatim extraction as per its instruction, which resulted in phrases like 'In fact, without erythema' and 'aim of fluid is nodule that is triggering'. The benchmark, however, contained clinically refined phrases like 'No erythema' and 'A1 pulley. Nodule palpable.'. While the candidate was more verbatim to the raw audio, it did not match the benchmark's content, which serves as the ground truth for this evaluation. The difference in anatomical reference ('aim of fluid' vs 'A1 pulley') is a significant factual discrepancy when comparing to the benchmark."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate provided 'X-rays are normal'. The benchmark provided 'X-rays of the left small finger are normal.'. The candidate's response is accurate and from the transcript, with the benchmark adding a relevant contextual detail. This is considered a minor wording difference with meaning preserved."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "While the core diagnosis 'Left small finger trigger finger with nodule' is correct, the candidate included 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.'. This directly contradicts the primary instruction 'Do not include normal findings' in the candidate's own prompt for this field, even though a conflicting instruction later suggested to include them. The benchmark correctly omits these normal findings, making the candidate's entry bloated and partially incorrect for an assessment section."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate correctly identified the 'trigger finger release'. However, it included several additional details not present in the benchmark or explicitly stated for this patient in the transcript (e.g., 'Discussed the procedure and expected recovery timeline.', 'Patient is advised to avoid repetitive gripping and heavy use'). The follow-up time also differed significantly ('6 to 8 weeks' vs benchmark's '2 weeks'), with both times being inferred or attributed incorrectly to this patient from the transcript. This indicates multiple instances of added, unverified details, bordering on minor hallucination."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 17,
  "percentage": 48.57,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in extracting straightforward information like the chief complaint and general imaging results. However, its overall performance was significantly hampered by inconsistent adherence to benchmark content, often due to conflicting or overly restrictive internal instructions that limited information or prompted the inclusion of irrelevant details. Specifically, the HPI was too brief, the musculoskeletal exam diverged from the benchmark's corrected phrasing, the assessment included inappropriate normal findings, and the plan contained several unverified inferences/hallucinations for the specific patient. The patient name discrepancy highlighted a conflict between the benchmark's format and the candidate's explicit instruction."
