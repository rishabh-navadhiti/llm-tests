  "field_scores": {
    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The candidate completely failed to extract the patient's name, returning a pronoun ('She') instead of the actual name ('Susan Oakes') as provided in the benchmark note. The benchmark is considered the ground truth for this field."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The candidate accurately identifies symptoms (achiness, limited motion, electric sensation) but misses the primary context of 'Follow-up' which is present in the benchmark and implied by the doctor's initial statement. The candidate's entry includes more detail than typically expected for a concise chief complaint."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate attempted to follow its instruction to provide Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity (ODLS) format. However, the benchmark note provides a detailed narrative HPI that directly reflects the transcript and includes significant contextual information (e.g., patient doing okay overall, life being difficult, nerve studies, asking about results) that the candidate's ODLS format entirely omits. The candidate's content significantly deviates from the factual completeness of the benchmark's narrative HPI."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate extracted 'Exam is unchanged' verbatim from the transcript, which adheres to its instruction. However, the benchmark note, which serves as the ground truth, explicitly lists '-' for this field. This indicates that the benchmark determined no specific musculoskeletal findings were to be recorded here, thus the candidate's content does not match the benchmark's intended output for this specific field."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate provides detailed nerve study results as dictated in the transcript, which are factually accurate. However, the benchmark note provides a general summary 'Nerve study results'. While the candidate's output is more informative regarding the actual findings, it does not match the specific concise content chosen by the benchmark for this field. This is a significant difference in content detail."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate successfully included all key items that the benchmark's `history.data` indicated as intended content for the Assessment section. Furthermore, it accurately added other clinically relevant diagnoses/assessments from the transcript (no evidence of carpal tunnel, possible ulnar nerve compression, cervical radiculopathy under evaluation) that enhance the completeness of the assessment without being incorrect. The candidate also correctly followed the (contradictory) instruction to include 'skin is intact' and 'no tenderness to palpation', matching the benchmark's inclusion of these. Minor formatting differences exist, but the meaning is preserved and enhanced."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate's plan section is an excellent and comprehensive summary of the dictated plan. It accurately captures all key elements from the transcript, closely matching or rephrasing the benchmark's content. Notably, the candidate corrected a factual inaccuracy present in the benchmark ('neurology' vs. 'urology' consult as dictated in the transcript), demonstrating superior fidelity to the source audio. The formatting and conversational tone adhere well to the instructions."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 16,
  "percentage": 45.71,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated significant variability in its performance across different fields. It struggled notably with fields requiring extraction of specific patient identifying information (PATIENT_NAME) and adhering to the benchmark's specific content choices or narrative style for HPI and Musculoskeletal findings. For Imaging Results, it provided factually correct but more detailed content than the benchmark's concise entry. However, the candidate performed strongly in complex sections like Assessment and excelled in the Plan section, providing a comprehensive and accurate summary that even corrected a minor factual error found in the benchmark, showcasing its ability to synthesize and structure clinical information effectively when instructions are aligned with its capabilities."
