  "field_scores": {
    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate included 'Mr.' which is not part of the patient's name itself, deviating slightly from the 'Only return the patients name' instruction. The meaning is preserved."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The transcript states 'he states that he has no pain.' as the patient's complaint. While 'for follow-up' is the reason for the visit, 'no pain' is the actual chief complaint mentioned. The candidate incorrectly identified 'Follow-up' as the chief complaint, which is a major factual difference."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate attempted to adhere to the instruction for Onset, Duration, Location, and Severity (ODS), but the transcript did not provide these details. The candidate hallucinated 'onset unknown, duration ongoing, location unspecified, severity 0/10'. The benchmark correctly extracted 'He reports no pain. He wants to know what is going on.' which was directly stated in the transcript. The hallucination of ODS details is a major factual inaccuracy, despite the instruction."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate's output for this field is highly accurate and adheres perfectly to the 'verbatim' instruction. It correctly captures all dictated details, including 'for patient', unlike the benchmark which slightly modified it. Minor capitalization difference ('pin' vs 'Pin') does not detract from verbatim accuracy."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate perfectly matched the benchmark and the transcript for imaging results. It is factually accurate and complete."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The instruction for this field is contradictory regarding 'normal findings'. The candidate, like the benchmark, included 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.', which follows the latter part of the instruction. However, the candidate additionally included 'Stiff fingers.', which is an exam finding and not typically part of the 'Assessment' list of conditions/issues, and explicitly contradicted by the instruction 'Do not include any exam findings'. The benchmark did not include 'Stiff fingers'."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate provided a comprehensive and highly accurate plan that captures all details from the transcript, including the specifics of the 10-day follow-up ('Likely pin removal or repeat X-rays') which the benchmark omitted. The phrasing is appropriate for a scribe note, and the information is well-organized in a list format."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 24,
  "percentage": 68.57,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note performed strongly in fields requiring verbatim extraction (Musculoskeletal, Imaging) and demonstrated excellent comprehension in detailing the Plan, often being more comprehensive than the benchmark. However, it struggled significantly with the Chief Complaint, misinterpreting the patient's statement, and hallucinated details in the HPI due to a problematic instruction not aligned with transcript content. The Assessment field showed minor deviation by including an exam finding not present in the benchmark, despite contradictory instructions for normal findings."
