  "field_scores": {
    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Perfect match to the benchmark and correctly extracts only the patient's name as per instructions."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The benchmark includes 'Forearm pain, thumb pain', while the candidate only listed 'Thumb pain'. The transcript explicitly mentions 'her forearm pain is better' in addition to 'her thumb pain is killing her', indicating both were part of the chief complaint. Missing the forearm pain component is a factual omission."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate's HPI content deviates significantly from the benchmark. While it followed its own highly restrictive instructions (Onset, Duration, Location, Severity), these instructions resulted in a note that misses critical contextual details present in the benchmark and transcript, such as forearm pain being better, the patient's specific question about alleviating pain, the daughter's wedding, and the impact of reduced hand use on pain. It also inferred 'Onset: Recent' and 'Duration: Ongoing' which were not explicitly stated."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate accurately transcribed most of the musculoskeletal findings verbatim. However, it omitted 'Right upper extremity' which was present in the benchmark and the doctor's dictation. Given the 'must be verbatim' instruction, this is a minor deviation."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The benchmark states 'X-rays reviewed. It shows planned arthritis.' which is directly from the transcript ('It'll be planned arthritis'). The candidate provided 'X-rays reviewed. Mild to moderate degenerative changes consistent with trapeziometacarpal joint arthritis.' This is an interpretation/elaboration not explicitly dictated, adding details not in the source."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate's assessment includes 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' and 'No tenderness to palpation.', which explicitly contradict its primary instruction to 'Do not include normal findings'. While the instruction later provides contradictory examples, following the core rule of an assessment (active conditions only) makes these inclusions incorrect and deviates significantly from the concise benchmark."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate's plan is comprehensive and accurately reflects all points from the benchmark and the transcript. It also adds clinically appropriate specificity (e.g., 'into the right trapeziometacarpal joint', 'for follow-up if symptoms persist') without hallucinating, and adheres to the requested format."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 22,
  "percentage": 62.85714285714286,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in accurately capturing the patient's name and the comprehensive treatment plan, achieving perfect scores in these areas. However, it struggled significantly with fields where the instructions were either overly restrictive (HPI_SPENCER) leading to a lack of crucial contextual information, or contradictory (ASSESSMENT_SPENCER) leading to the inclusion of irrelevant details that violated core rules. Minor omissions were noted in the musculoskeletal exam, and the imaging results included an interpretation not explicitly dictated, impacting factual accuracy. The note's adherence to its own complex and sometimes conflicting instructions impacted its overall factual completeness and clinical relevance compared to the benchmark."
