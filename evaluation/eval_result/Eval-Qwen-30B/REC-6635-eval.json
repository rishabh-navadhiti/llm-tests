  "field_scores": {
    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The candidate provided 'Spencer' as the patient's name, which is incorrect. The benchmark note specifies 'Jedediah Voltz', and 'Spencer' appears to be an internal field name from the prompt, not the patient's actual name from the transcript or benchmark."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate's chief complaint 'Index finger pain and stiffness' perfectly matches the benchmark note and is accurately extracted from the transcript."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "While the candidate accurately extracted the 'Onset', 'Location', and 'Severity' based on its specific instructions, it completely missed significant portions of the HPI narrative present in both the transcript and the benchmark, such as the patient's profession, the full mechanism of injury, details about the urgent care visit, suture removal, and the wound re-opening. This represents multiple missing details compared to the benchmark's comprehensive HPI."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate's output for musculoskeletal exam is almost verbatim from the transcript ('Left upper extremity in- a laceration well-healing, um, without sutures. A very stiff index finger PIP able to flex only about 10 degrees actively at this time. Moderate soft tissue swelling, no sensory tenderness to palpation. Excellent range of motion of the remaining digit.'). The benchmark is slightly rephrased and formatted as a list, but the factual content and meaning are perfectly preserved. The candidate followed its 'verbatim' instruction very well."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate's 'X-rays are normal' is a perfect match to the benchmark and the doctor's statement in the transcript."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate included several exam findings ('Moderate soft tissue swelling', 'No sensory tenderness to palpation', 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact') in the assessment, which are not typically part of the 'Assessment' section (diagnoses/problems). The benchmark correctly lists only the primary issues ('Laceration of the left index finger', 'Stiff left index finger'). Although the candidate's instructions for this field were contradictory regarding normal findings, its output deviates significantly from standard assessment content and the benchmark."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate's plan is concise, accurate, and clearly written. It covers the essential components of the plan (hand therapy, follow-up appointment with time and purpose) as dictated, and even slightly improves upon the benchmark's fragmented first point ('Plan proximal interphalangeal') by integrating it into a clear recommendation."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 22,
  "percentage": 62.857142857142854,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in fields like Chief Complaint, Imaging Results, and Plan, accurately capturing and structuring the information. Its verbatim extraction for Musculoskeletal exam was also highly accurate. However, its overall score was significantly impacted by critical failures in the Patient Name field (completely incorrect) and the Assessment field (incorrectly including exam findings). The HPI section, while adhering to the candidate's own restrictive instructions, missed substantial narrative and contextual details present in the benchmark and transcript, leading to a less comprehensive output."
