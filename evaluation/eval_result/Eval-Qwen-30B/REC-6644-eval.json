  "field_scores": {
    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark note is for 'Cathy Smith'. While 'Cathy Smith' is listed, the candidate note erroneously includes two other patient names ('Brigitte Metman', 'Samar Actrion') from the transcript, demonstrating a failure to scope the note to the specific patient."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark's chief complaint for Cathy Smith is 'Follow up hand pain and swelling'. The candidate note lists chief complaints for other patients from the transcript ('Increasing pain and deformity in fingers', 'Burning pain from mid-palm to mid-forearm', 'Progressively worsening bilateral hand pain') none of which are correct for Cathy Smith. This field is completely incorrect."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark provides Cathy Smith's HPI as a follow-up. The candidate note instead extracts HPI details (Onset, duration, location, severity) for the first patient mentioned in the transcript (regarding DIP joint arthritis), not Cathy Smith. This is completely irrelevant to Cathy Smith's visit."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate note includes the correct verbatim musculoskeletal findings for Cathy Smith. However, it also includes extensive verbatim findings for two other patients discussed in the transcript, making the output significantly diluted with irrelevant information and failing to scope to the correct patient."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The benchmark correctly indicates no imaging results for Cathy Smith's current visit ('-'). The candidate note includes imaging results for the first patient mentioned in the transcript and also for Brigitte Metman ('X-rays are normal'), neither of which are relevant to Cathy Smith's visit."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate correctly identifies 'Persistent post-surgical tenderness and scarring at A1 pulley site' for Cathy Smith, which is relevant. However, it includes numerous assessment items for the other two patients discussed in the transcript and violates the instruction 'Do not include normal findings' by including 'Right upper extremity skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation'."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate correctly includes Cathy Smith's plan items ('Continue hand therapy... transition of care to Jack is approved.', 'Return to clinic in six weeks for follow-up.'). However, similar to other fields, it severely dilutes this information by including the full plans for the other two patients mentioned in the transcript. This represents a major content difference due to the vast amount of irrelevant information."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 3,
  "percentage": 8.57,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note performed poorly across all fields primarily due to a fundamental failure to scope the generated content to the specific patient (Cathy Smith) represented in the benchmark note. Instead of focusing on Cathy Smith, the model extracted and combined information from all three patient encounters mentioned in the transcript. While some verbatim information for Cathy Smith was correctly extracted in the 'MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM' and 'PLAN_SPENCER_' fields, it was heavily diluted by irrelevant data from other patients. The 'PATIENT_NAME', 'CHIEF_COMPLAINT', 'HPI_SPENCER', and 'IMAGING_RESULTS' fields were largely or entirely incorrect for the target patient. This indicates a significant issue with context awareness and patient isolation."
