| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name is not mentioned in the provided transcript. The candidate correctly identifies the absence of the name by returning an empty content array with a '-' default, which aligns with the instruction to return '-' if not present. The benchmark includes a name not present in the transcript, which is outside the scope of this evaluation's transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate accurately captures the chief complaint 'numbness and tingling of her right hand' which is directly from the transcript and matches the core meaning of the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate provides a well-summarized HPI, capturing most key details regarding the numbness, lymphoma, thumb burn, and phone usage. However, it omits the explicit statements that the patient is 'here for reevaluation' and 'here for evaluation and treatment,' which are part of the initial HPI context given in the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate fails to adhere to the 'must be verbatim' instruction for this field. It rephrases 'There is triggering there. There is a nodule there.' into 'A nodule and triggering are present' and entirely omits 'A one foley' (likely A1 pulley) which was dictated in the transcript. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate accurately extracts the imaging result 'X-ray is clear' from the transcript and appropriately rephrases it as 'X-ray normal,' which preserves the meaning perfectly. The benchmark's 'XR - Deferred' is inconsistent with the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate accurately identifies 'Right small finger trigger' and 'Carpal tunnel syndrome' as active problems from the doctor's statements. It also correctly includes 'History of lymphoma,' which is a relevant diagnosis mentioned in the HPI, providing a comprehensive assessment consistent with instructions. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate accurately captures all key elements of the plan from the transcript, presenting them in a concise and appropriate scribe-style summary. The condensation of the trigger finger injection rationale into a clear plan item is consistent with the instruction for a scribe-style summary. |

**Total Score:** 31

**Percentage:** 88.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed very well overall, accurately extracting and summarizing most information according to clinical note style. It excelled in the Chief Complaint, Imaging Results, Assessment, and Plan sections, often providing a more complete and appropriate clinical summary than the benchmark for those fields. The primary weakness was in the Musculoskeletal section, where it failed to adhere to the strict 'verbatim' instruction by rephrasing and omitting details. There was also a minor omission of the explicit visit purpose in the HPI.

| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | The benchmark, considered the ground truth, spells the patient's last name as 'Kaffee', while the candidate uses 'Coffee'. This is a minor spelling difference for a name, but the meaning is preserved. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate's 'Pain in left index finger.' is a minor phrasing difference from the benchmark's 'Left index finger pain'. The meaning is preserved, but the benchmark is slightly more concise and typical for a chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate states 'Dr. Almadroa' which is present in the transcript, but the benchmark (ground truth) has corrected this to 'Dr. Dellamaggiora'. This is a factual inaccuracy compared to the benchmark. The candidate also uses 'shoulder issue' instead of 'shoulder appointment' and 'prompting her to seek further evaluation' instead of 'She is here today for evaluation of her left index finger' as found in the benchmark. The benchmark also includes a date not in the transcript, which is not penalized for the candidate. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The candidate's content significantly differs from the benchmark, even though it closely matches the transcript. Key discrepancies compared to the benchmark include: 'tacky' vs 'intact'; missing 'or ecchymosis'; 'walking catching' vs 'locking and catching'; and adding 'Able to give a thumbs up.' which is not in the benchmark content. These are substantial factual deviations from the established ground truth of the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | The candidate's 'X-rays of the finger are normal.' is missing specific details present in the benchmark: 'Three views' and 'left index finger'. While 'finger' is implied, the benchmark makes it explicit and includes the number of views. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate inappropriately includes 'Tenderness on left index finger with A1 pulley.' which is an exam finding, not an assessment, violating the instruction to avoid exam details. Furthermore, it uses 'Triggering of index finger' (a symptom) instead of the more diagnostic 'Trigger finger' used in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate paraphrases and interprets the benchmark's two distinct plan lines into one ('Plan to perform trigger finger injection today.' vs 'Plan trigger' and 'She has not had any injection, we will do this today'). More critically, the candidate includes 'X-rays of the finger are normal' in the plan section, whereas the benchmark correctly places imaging results in a separate 'IMAGING_GEORGE' section, indicating a significant structural and categorical error compared to the benchmark's organization. |

**Total Score:** 17

**Percentage:** 48.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates reasonable performance in basic information extraction like patient name and chief complaint, although with minor wording variations from the benchmark. However, its performance significantly degrades in more complex fields requiring summarization, factual precision, and adherence to clinical note structure as defined by the benchmark. There are notable discrepancies in factual details (e.g., doctor's name in HPI, musculoskeletal findings), failure to use diagnostic terms in the assessment, and a lack of adherence to the benchmark's categorical separation for imaging results in the plan. The candidate often adhered more closely to the raw transcript than the human-corrected benchmark, which resulted in lower scores due to the benchmark being the designated ground truth.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The candidate note correctly identifies that the patient's name is not explicitly mentioned in the transcript and returns '-' as instructed, perfectly matching the benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The candidate note states 'Evaluation of left small finger', which is a reason for visit, not the primary chief complaint. The transcript clearly indicates the patient 'first noticed locking and catching', which is the actual chief complaint and correctly captured in the benchmark. The candidate missed this key symptom. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate note accurately summarizes the HPI details from the transcript (right-hand dominant designer, locking/catching 2 years ago, delayed treatment due to previous surgeries, now seeking evaluation). It correctly avoids inferring details (like symptom impact on job) that were not explicitly stated in the transcript, which the benchmark included. This demonstrates strong adherence to instructions. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate note failed on the 'verbatim' instruction for this section. It incorrectly interprets 'at the small finger aim of fluid is nodule that is triggering that excellent range of motion overall' as 'A small nodule is present at the metacarpophalangeal joint, triggering excellent range of motion'. This modifies the doctor's dictation, changes 'aim of fluid' to an anatomical location not explicitly stated, and misinterprets 'triggering' and 'excellent range of motion' as a combined observation, whereas they are distinct in the transcript. The benchmark correctly parses these details. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate note states 'X-rays normal for the finger', which is very close to the transcript's 'X-rays are normal for reduced the finger' (likely 'of the finger'). The meaning is preserved, and the wording is nearly verbatim, leading to a strong score despite a minor difference from the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate correctly identifies 'Trigger finger (left small finger)'. However, it incorrectly includes 'Status post trigger finger surgery (middle finger)'. The instructions state to 'Only include 'status post' conditions if they describe an ongoing issue'. The transcript explicitly mentions 'well-healed trigger finger incisions to the middle finger', implying it's not an ongoing issue relevant to the current assessment, making its inclusion incorrect based on the rubric. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate note accurately extracts the plan relevant to the first patient ('Planned trigger finger surgery for the left small finger') based on the transcript's 'plan will be, uh, planned trigger'. Crucially, it does not include follow-up information or other details that were stated for the *second* patient in the transcript but not the first, unlike the benchmark note which appears to hallucinate a 2-week follow-up for the first patient. This demonstrates excellent adherence to scope. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The AI-generated note demonstrated a good overall understanding of extracting clinical information, particularly excelling in fields requiring direct extraction and contextual relevance while avoiding hallucination from other patient data in the transcript. This was evident in the HPI, Imaging Results, and Plan sections, where it adhered well to the given instructions. However, the note struggled with precision in the Chief Complaint by being too generic, and most notably in the Musculoskeletal Verbatim section, where it failed to adhere to the strict 'verbatim' instruction, introducing inaccuracies and misinterpretations. The Assessment section also included irrelevant historical information despite clear instructions. Improving verbatim extraction and adhering to specificity guidelines would further enhance its quality.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient name "Susan Shell" is not mentioned in the transcript. The candidate correctly returned an empty content array, which aligns with its instruction to return "-" if the name is not present in the transcript. The benchmark includes "Susan Shell" which is not derivable from the provided transcript; therefore, the candidate is not penalized for its absence. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The candidate correctly identified "Wrist pain" as the chief complaint, but incorrectly included "and interest in total wrist arthroplasty." While factually derived from the transcript, this adds context beyond a concise chief complaint and goes against its own instruction to avoid "additional details or context" for the chief complaint itself. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate provides a reasonable summary of the HPI. However, it omits several minor factual details explicitly stated in the transcript and present in the benchmark, such as the patient having "all of her other medical conditions taken care of," her desire to "know how things look" regarding her knee, and being "here for evaluation and treatment." |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The candidate incorrectly extracted "Bilateral wrist arthritis" as a musculoskeletal exam finding; this is a diagnosis/condition discussed later, not a verbatim physical examination finding from the 'Exam' section. The actual relevant exam finding mentioned was "Exam mostly unchanged, except you can delete the large, poorly defined nodule," which the candidate entirely missed capturing in any form. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | The candidate failed to extract the imaging result mentioned by the doctor: "The imaging you can leave all the same," which correctly implies "Imaging mostly unchanged" as noted in the benchmark. The candidate returned an empty field, indicating no imaging results were found. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate accurately identified all three active problems from the transcript: "Synovitis (improved)", "Bilateral wrist arthritis", and "Osteoporosis". The addition of "(improved)" for synovitis is also accurate. The benchmark incorrectly omitted "Osteoporosis" which was clearly stated in the transcript as an active condition. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate accurately identified the core plan of a right total wrist arthroplasty. However, it significantly hallucinates "Follow-up as needed," which is not mentioned anywhere in the transcript. It also misses crucial details about the rationale for proceeding with the plan (synovitis down, knee recovered), which are present in the benchmark and transcript. |

**Total Score:** 19

**Percentage:** 54.28571428571429

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates variable performance across different fields. It performed excellently in `PATIENT_NAME` and `ASSESSMENT_SPENCER` by accurately reflecting or extracting content. However, it showed significant weaknesses in `MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM` and `IMAGING_RESULTS` by either misinterpreting or missing direct clinical findings. The `PLAN_SPENCER_` field included a significant hallucination, indicating a need for stricter adherence to transcript content. The `HPI_SPENCER` and `CHIEF_COMPLAINT` fields were mostly correct but lacked some minor details or included extraneous information, respectively, indicating room for improved conciseness and completeness.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient name 'Sandra Herrara' is not mentioned in the provided transcript. The candidate correctly returned an empty content array with the default '-', aligning with its instructions to not guess. The benchmark's inclusion of a name likely comes from external information not present in this specific transcript, therefore no penalty is applied. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate's 'Lack of relief from previous injection' directly reflects the transcript's 'injection did not offer any relief'. The benchmark's 'Follow up for hand pain' is a more generalized, yet standard, chief complaint. While the candidate's is directly inferable, the benchmark provides a more encompassing and typical chief complaint for a follow-up visit. The meaning is preserved with minor wording and scope differences. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate note accurately captures all factual content from the transcript regarding the HPI. Minor wording differences (e.g., 'did not provide any relief' vs 'did not offer any relief', 'seeking further evaluation to determine the cause of her ongoing symptoms' vs 'wants to know what is going on') preserve the original meaning perfectly. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The candidate correctly identifies hypopigmentation and mild tenderness. However, it significantly misrepresents the special tests. The transcript mentions 'positive finger stain' (interpreted as Finkelstein in benchmark) and 'still a positive, um, grind'. The candidate incorrectly combines and mislabels these as 'Positive finger grind test,' completely missing the Finkelstein test and misnaming the Grind test. This constitutes multiple missing/incorrect details. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging results were mentioned in the transcript. Both the benchmark and candidate correctly reflect this by indicating no content. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The benchmark's 'Pain in hand' is a concise and appropriate problem statement for the assessment. The candidate includes 'No relief from previous injection,' which is a valid active problem. However, it incorrectly includes 'Positive finger grind test,' which is an exam finding and should not be listed as an assessment problem. This indicates a misunderstanding of clinical note structure for this section. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate followed its instruction to provide verbatim content for 'dig verban's injection', but the benchmark correctly identifies this as 'de Quervain's injection', which is medically accurate. As the benchmark is the ground truth, the candidate's verbatim retention of a medically inaccurate term is a factual error from a clinical perspective. The candidate also omitted 'Her previous injection offered no relief' which the benchmark included as a key point in the plan, even if it's a rationale rather than a direct action. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.28

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in accurately extracting History of Present Illness details and correctly identifying the absence of patient name and imaging results. However, it struggled significantly with the Musculoskeletal exam findings, exhibiting errors in identifying and labeling specific tests. The Assessment section also showed weaknesses by including an exam finding as a problem. Furthermore, in the Plan section, while adhering to verbatim extraction instructions, it failed to correct a medically inaccurate term dictated by the doctor, which the human-reviewed benchmark appropriately rectified. This highlights a need for improved clinical interpretation and adherence to medical accuracy, even when specific instructions emphasize verbatim transcription.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The candidate perfectly matched the patient's name as stated in the transcript and benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate included 'after a trip and fall' which is additional context not expected for a concise chief complaint based on the benchmark. The benchmark provided a more direct and concise chief complaint ('Left wrist pain'). |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate missed the detail 'while leaving Groundlings'. Additionally, it included 'Stephanie Humphrey, a right-hand dominant horticulturalist' which, while present in the transcript, is generally considered patient demographics or an introductory detail rather than part of the HPI narrative focused strictly on the history of the present illness itself, as implied by the field's instructions. The benchmark was more concise and focused on the HPI narrative. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The benchmark has '-' for this field, indicating no specific verbatim musculoskeletal findings should be present. The candidate, however, included extensive musculoskeletal exam findings, which are present in the transcript. Despite the candidate's content being largely accurate to the transcript, it represents a major content difference from the benchmark, which is considered the ground truth. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | The candidate only included the current X-ray results ('X-rays of the left wrist are normal'). It missed the historical imaging results from urgent care ('X-rays that showed no fractures'), which are present in both the transcript and the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | The candidate correctly identified and listed the two key assessments ('Left ECU tendonitis', 'Left ulnar-sided wrist pain'). However, the benchmark also included two additional lines ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.') which are exam findings, not typical assessments/diagnoses, and one is even for the wrong extremity. While the candidate followed common clinical note standards and the instructions to exclude normal/negative findings, it is penalized for not matching the benchmark's full content as per evaluation rules. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate perfectly matched the plan items as dictated in the transcript and present in the benchmark. The order difference is a harmless formatting difference. |

**Total Score:** 22

**Percentage:** 62.857142857142854

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in extracting direct patient information and the treatment plan. It achieved perfect scores for 'PATIENT_NAME' and 'PLAN_SPENCER_'. However, its performance was weaker in fields requiring more nuanced interpretation or adherence to specific content rules, particularly when the benchmark's content diverged from typical clinical note practices or the AI's own field instructions. Missing historical imaging details and including extraneous information in the HPI led to deductions. A significant penalty was incurred for 'MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM' where the candidate accurately extracted information from the transcript, but the benchmark was intentionally empty for this field. Similarly, for 'ASSESSMENT_SPENCER', the candidate correctly filtered out non-assessment findings, but the benchmark included them, leading to a lower score based on strict content comparison. This highlights a challenge where the benchmark may not always align with optimal clinical note structure or the explicit instructions provided to the model for specific fields.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name is not mentioned in the transcript. The candidate correctly returned '-', adhering to its instruction for when the name is not present. The benchmark included a name not explicitly dictated, but the evaluation instructions state not to penalize for information in the benchmark not available in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The candidate correctly identified 'wrist pain' (achiness) and 'numbness/tingling' (electric sensation). However, it missed 'limited motion' and the overall context of it being a 'follow-up' visit, which were explicitly stated in the transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate captured the main symptoms (stable wrist pain, limited motion, electric sensations). However, it omitted several explicit details from the transcript such as 'life is difficult at the moment,' 'finally had her nerve studies,' and the patient's direct question about the nerve studies. The phrase 'The symptoms have been present without progression' is a good summary but not verbatim, whereas the benchmark includes more verbatim details. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The transcript only states 'Her exam is unchanged' and does not provide any specific verbatim musculoskeletal findings. Both the benchmark ('-') and the candidate ('[]') correctly reflect the absence of specific dictated findings. The formatting difference is minor and aligns with the candidate's default output for this field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate accurately extracted the specific nerve study findings explicitly mentioned in the transcript ('no evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome' and 'possible evidence of ulnar nerve compression at Guyon's canal'). The benchmark's entry 'Nerve study results' is very general and less informative, while the candidate provides the actual results as dictated, fulfilling the purpose of the field more effectively. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate correctly identified and listed the key active problems/conditions based on the transcript: 'Wrist pain,' 'Numbness/tingling in hand,' and 'Possible ulnar nerve compression at Guyon's canal.' These points accurately reflect the patient's symptoms and the doctor's diagnostic impressions. The benchmark's initial empty content for this field is less comprehensive. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate's plan is significantly abridged and misses multiple key details from the transcript. It omitted the positive status of the wrist ('doing well,' 'continuing to gain strength,' 'advanced weightbearing' tolerated), the instruction to 'delete the carpal tunnel,' the detailed explanation of nerve study findings within the plan (no carpal tunnel, ulnar nerve compression but asymptomatic, watch this for now), and the specific disability information ('Disability, um, okay for full duty starting 9-1-2025'). The candidate only provided a very partial summary of the extensive plan dictated. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed well in fields where specific extraction or direct clinical interpretation was required, such as Patient Name, Musculoskeletal Verbatim, Imaging Results, and Assessment. It accurately identified and presented key information in these sections. However, the candidate struggled with the Chief Complaint and History of Present Illness, missing several minor but explicit details. Its most significant weakness was in the Plan section, where it provided a heavily abridged summary, omitting numerous important instructions and details dictated by the doctor, indicating a substantial loss of factual content.

| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | While the benchmark is incorrect for this field (missing all information), the candidate's extraction, though present, fails to be truly verbatim as per its own instruction. It consolidates phrases and omits minor words/phrases ('without anything by my diagnosis', 'No tenderness or location over the mass', 'very', 'or location'). This indicates multiple missing/modified details from a verbatim requirement. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate accurately extracted all imaging results. There are minor wording differences from the transcript and benchmark (e.g., 'X-rays show' vs 'Outside X-rays showed' vs 'outside X-rays are viewed with'), but the meaning is perfectly preserved. The combination of ultrasound findings into one sentence is a formatting choice and does not alter the content. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate correctly identified the active problems from the transcript and adhered to the instruction by *not* including physical exam findings or negative statements, unlike the benchmark which contains irrelevant physical exam findings and an incorrect laterality ('Bilateral hand pain' instead of 'Left wrist pain'). The candidate's output is superior and factually correct from the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate accurately captured most of the plan items, including a detail about carpal tunnel syndrome missed by the benchmark. However, it added the phrase 'if symptoms worsen' regarding the aspiration/biopsy of the wrist mass, which was not mentioned in the transcript. This constitutes a minor hallucination/incorrect detail. |

**Total Score:** 28

**Percentage:** 80.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in accurately extracting patient demographics, chief complaint, and assessment findings, particularly excelling where the benchmark contained errors or irrelevant information (e.g., Assessment field). The HPI and Imaging sections were largely accurate with only minor rephrasing or omissions. However, the candidate significantly underperformed in the Musculoskeletal section, failing to provide a verbatim extraction as instructed, and introduced a minor hallucination in the Plan section. This indicates a need for improvement in adhering to strict verbatim instructions and preventing additions not present in the source transcript.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The candidate note perfectly matches the patient's name as provided in the benchmark and confirmed by the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate's 'Evaluation of left wrist pain' is factually accurate based on the transcript. However, 'Left wrist pain' (benchmark) is a more concise and standard representation for a chief complaint. The meaning is preserved with a minor wording difference. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate note is an excellent and near-perfect match to the benchmark, accurately summarizing all HPI details from the transcript. The only negligible difference is 'ultrasound of the wrist' compared to the benchmark's 'ultrasound of the anterior wrist' (from 'front of the wrist' in transcript). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The benchmark specifies '-' for this field, indicating no content. However, the candidate extracted extensive, factually accurate, and verbatim musculoskeletal findings directly from the transcript, adhering to its specific instruction to extract verbatim findings. Given the benchmark is considered the ground truth, the presence of content where the benchmark indicates none constitutes a major content difference, despite the candidate's accuracy relative to the transcript and its own instructions. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate accurately extracted all imaging findings. The primary difference is the candidate combining two ultrasound findings into one sentence using 'and', whereas the benchmark separated them. This is a minor formatting/wording difference, but the factual content and meaning are perfectly preserved. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Compared to the benchmark, the candidate note is missing two minor details that were present in the benchmark: 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation'. While the candidate's omissions align with its own instructions to exclude normal/negative findings, strict adherence to the benchmark as ground truth results in a 'missing details' penalty. The candidate also added 'Left wrist pain' which was not explicitly listed in the benchmark's assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | The candidate's plan is largely accurate and often more comprehensive, including details like 'for carpal tunnel' and 'for follow-up' that were present in the transcript but omitted or less specific in the benchmark. However, the candidate added 'Consider' for aspiration/biopsy, which was not verbatim from the transcript. This is a minor non-verbatim addition. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.28

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong performance in extracting patient information and historical details, achieving perfect scores in Patient Name and HPI. It accurately extracts Chief Complaint and Imaging Results with only minor formatting/wording differences. However, strict adherence to the benchmark as ground truth, even when it conflicts with the candidate's instructions or transcript content, led to significant deductions in the Musculoskeletal Verbatim and Assessment fields. While the candidate often provided more complete or clinically relevant information (e.g., in Assessment and Plan) based on the transcript and its own guidelines, the direct comparison to a benchmark with different content inclusion criteria resulted in lower scores for those specific fields. The plan section was generally well-captured, with only a minor non-verbatim addition.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Perfect match in factual content: 'Left ring finger trigger finger' is accurately extracted. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's HPI description ('The patient is scheduled to receive a left ring finger trigger finger injection. The procedure will be injection only.') details the *plan* for the patient rather than the history of their present illness. The benchmark correctly captures the chief complaint as the HPI. This is a major content difference due to miscategorization of information. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The candidate incorrectly identified 'Plantar tendonitis' as a musculoskeletal physical examination finding. In the transcript, 'plantar tendonitis' is stated as a diagnosis or assessment, not a verbatim physical exam observation. The benchmark correctly leaves this field blank, indicating no explicit musculoskeletal verbatim findings were dictated. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Perfect match. Both the benchmark and candidate correctly state '-' as no imaging results were mentioned in the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate listed 'Trigger finger' instead of 'Left ring finger trigger finger' as in the benchmark, missing the laterality and specific digit. While 'Plantar tendonitis' was correctly included, the omission of 'Left ring finger' is a missing minor detail for the first diagnosis. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate's plan is missing significant details. It completely omits the 'Left ring finger trigger finger injection' which was the primary stated plan. It also missed 'for plantar tendonitis' in relation to the 'Home exercise program'. The benchmark includes 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks' which is not in the transcript, and the candidate is not penalized for this absence. |

**Total Score:** 20

**Percentage:** 57.14285714285714

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated strength in accurately identifying the chief complaint and the absence of imaging results. However, it performed poorly in sections requiring contextual understanding, such as HPI, Musculoskeletal Verbatim, and Plan. The HPI incorrectly contained details belonging to the plan, and a diagnosis was misinterpreted as a physical exam finding. The Plan section suffered from significant omissions of key treatment details. While some minor details were missed in the Assessment, the major issues were conceptual miscategorization and critical omissions, resulting in an incomplete and partially inaccurate clinical note.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | The benchmark identifies 'No pain' as the chief complaint, which is explicitly stated in the transcript. The candidate provided 'Wants to know what is going on,' which is also stated but misses the primary chief complaint as identified by the benchmark. This constitutes a significant missing detail. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate's HPI ('Mr. Parviz Mikael is here for follow-up. He reports no pain and states that he wants to know what is going on.') is highly accurate and comprehensive, including all relevant information from the transcript for HPI. The benchmark is slightly more concise but the candidate's version is also perfectly accurate and provides full context from the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | The candidate included 'for patient' and 'um,' which are present in the transcript but omitted by the benchmark. While the candidate adhered more closely to a 'verbatim' instruction, the evaluation is against the benchmark. These are minor wording differences, and the core factual content remains identical. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate's imaging results ('X-rays are the same as the last time.') are an exact match to the benchmark's content. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's assessment items ('Stiff fingers', 'Plexal ligament split') are entirely different from the benchmark's ('Right upper extremity Skin is intact.', 'No tenderness to palpation.'). While 'Stiff fingers' is a valid assessment from the transcript, 'Plexal ligament split' is a plan item and incorrectly placed in the assessment. The benchmark's items are also not fully verbatim from the transcript for an 'assessment' section. However, as the candidate's content shows major differences and includes an incorrect type of item (plan as assessment) when compared to the benchmark, it receives a low score. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate's plan is highly comprehensive and accurately captures all key elements from the transcript, including details like 'for follow-up' and 'possibly pin removal or repeat X-rays' which the benchmark either summarized less completely or omitted. The breakdown into separate points is logical and adheres well to a scribe-style summary, reflecting the full doctor's dictation better than the benchmark in some aspects. Despite minor rephrasing, the factual content and completeness are excellent. |

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The transcript does not mention the patient's name. The candidate correctly returned an empty content array, aligning with the instruction to return '-' if the name is not present. The benchmark includes a name not found in the transcript, which the candidate correctly did not hallucinate. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate's chief complaint is an exact match to the relevant portion of the transcript and aligns perfectly with the benchmark's meaning. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate accurately captures the onset, nature, and progression of symptoms, including the previous pregnancy comparison and the impact on sleep due to lack of improvement with splints. However, it omitted the detail about the patient seeing her OB who recommended injections and referred her to this office, which is part of the history of present illness and was included in the benchmark. This is a minor missing detail. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate accurately extracted the musculoskeletal exam findings verbatim from the transcript. It correctly filtered out the ambiguous 'Um... Got PCTS' which was unclear dictation and presented as '.PCTS' in the benchmark. The candidate maintained the integrity of the verbatim instruction. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | The candidate's imaging result is an exact, verbatim match to the transcript and the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate accurately listed the primary diagnosis ('Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome') along with key supporting symptoms and findings ('Bilateral hand numbness', 'Tingling', 'Burning pain', 'Decreased sensation to middle fingers'), adhering to the instruction to include both symptom-based and diagnosis-based problems. The benchmark was less complete by only including the diagnosis. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate accurately summarized the doctor's plan, including the recommendation for injections, discussion of risks, immediate action, and follow-up instructions. It correctly excluded information about past treatments (splinting) that belongs in the HPI rather than the current plan, which the benchmark included. |

**Total Score:** 34

**Percentage:** 97.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed exceptionally well, demonstrating strong factual accuracy and adherence to specific field instructions. It accurately extracted most details and summarized complex sections concisely in clinical note style. Minor points of improvement include a slight omission in the HPI regarding the OB referral and injection recommendation. The model correctly handled cases where information was not present in the transcript and accurately filtered out irrelevant or ambiguously dictated information, leading to a very high-quality clinical note.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name 'Greta Griswana' is perfectly matched in factual content. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | The benchmark includes 'Forearm pain, thumb pain'. The candidate only listed 'Thumb pain', missing 'forearm pain' which was mentioned as being better but still a part of her complaints. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | The candidate's HPI incorrectly includes objective exam findings ('On examination...', 'positive grind test...', 'No tenderness...', 'some tenderness...') and imaging results ('X-rays reveal planned arthritis, and a steroid injection is recommended'). The instructions explicitly state: 'Do NOT include any exam findings, physical measurements, imaging results, or other objective observations.' Additionally, the candidate missed crucial HPI information present in the transcript and benchmark, specifically about the daughter's wedding and how it affected her pain ('her daughter's wedding was this weekend, and so she did not have to do a lot with her hand and the pain is better, but overall it is the same.'). This is a major instruction violation and content difference. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | The instruction requires verbatim extraction. The candidate rephrased and omitted details. For example, 'Significant tendinous location' and 'imminence' were omitted. 'Right upper termine' was changed to 'right thumb', and 'with' was changed to 'at' for A1 pulley and U&R, which deviates from the verbatim requirement. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate provided 'X-rays show planned arthritis.' The benchmark has 'X-rays reviewed. It shows planned arthritis.' While the candidate slightly rephrased 'X-rays reviewed. It'll be planned arthritis' from the transcript, the meaning is preserved, and it's a minor wording difference. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | The benchmark correctly identifies 'Planned arthritis' as the assessment. The candidate included 'Thumb pain' (a symptom) and 'Positive grind test at trapeziometacarpal joint' (an exam finding) in the assessment. While symptoms can sometimes be included, an exam finding is generally not part of the assessment problem list, even with the given instruction 'Keep terms short and scribe-style, without exam details or explanations.' The inclusion of an exam detail as an assessment item is a deviation from clinical note standards for this section. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate note accurately captured all elements of the plan from the transcript, including the specific follow-up details ('for follow-up if symptoms persist'), which the benchmark slightly condensed. This is a perfect match and even more complete than the benchmark in this specific detail, while adhering to the instructions. |

**Total Score:** 23

**Percentage:** 65.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in extracting the patient's name and the treatment plan details. However, it exhibited significant weaknesses in adhering to specific field instructions, particularly for the HPI section, where objective findings were incorrectly included and subjective historical information was omitted. The verbatim requirement for the musculoskeletal exam was not met, and the assessment included an inappropriate exam finding. Overall, the note shows inconsistent quality with good performance on direct extractions but struggles with semantic understanding and adherence to formatting rules for structured fields like HPI and Musculoskeletal exam.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name 'Jedediah Voltz' is not present in the provided transcript. The candidate correctly returned an empty content array, which adheres to its instruction to return '-' if the name is not present. The benchmark contains information not derivable from the transcript, and per instructions, this is not penalized. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The candidate perfectly extracted the chief complaint 'Index finger pain and stiffness' as stated verbatim in the transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate provides a good, coherent summary of the HPI in a single paragraph, adhering to its instructions and accurately capturing the main events. However, it misses the specific anatomical detail 'PIP' or 'proximal interphalangeal' regarding the laceration location, which was mentioned in the transcript by the doctor ('index finger PIP laceration'). The benchmark includes this detail. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note is an excellent verbatim extraction of the musculoskeletal findings from the transcript. It maintains the exact phrasing ('no sensory tenderness to palpation', 'PIP', 'remaining digit') where the benchmark made minor alterations. Formatting differences are not penalized. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate accurately captures the imaging result. However, it omits the word 'are' ('X-rays normal' instead of 'X-rays are normal'), which deviates slightly from the verbatim instruction ('Return the findings exactly as dictated'). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate's assessment terms 'Index finger PIP laceration' and 'Stiff index finger PIP' are highly accurate and directly reflect the specific anatomical phrasing ('PIP') used in the transcript by both the patient and doctor when describing the conditions. The benchmark added 'left' which was implied but not explicitly stated as part of the diagnosis in the transcript for the assessment section. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | The candidate missed the 'Plan PIP' component which was explicitly stated by the doctor and included in the benchmark. Additionally, the candidate interpreted the ambiguous phrase 'image motion' as 'imaging' for the follow-up, which is less clinically plausible given the context (stiff finger, hand therapy) compared to the benchmark's interpretation of 'range of motion check', and neither are verbatim from the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 30

**Percentage:** 85.71428571428571

**Overall Summary:** The AI-generated clinical note performed very well, achieving high accuracy in several fields. It perfectly extracted the Chief Complaint, and demonstrated excellent verbatim transcription for the Musculoskeletal exam findings, even surpassing the benchmark in adherence to the transcript. The Assessment section was also highly accurate and clinically relevant, directly referencing terms from the transcript. Minor deductions were observed in the HPI, where a specific anatomical detail (PIP for laceration) was missed, and in Imaging Results, where a small word was omitted. The most significant area for improvement was the Plan section, where a key component ('Plan PIP') was entirely missed, and an ambiguous phrase ('image motion') was interpreted as 'imaging,' which was less clinically plausible than the benchmark's interpretation and deviated from a verbatim transcription. Overall, the note is of high quality with strong factual accuracy, but attention to all dictated details and careful handling of ambiguities could further enhance its performance.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Perfect match, the patient's name 'Chaz Thomas' is accurately extracted. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate provided 'Follow-up after removing splint.' while the benchmark has 'Follow-up'. The instruction specifies 'only the patient's chief complaint without any additional details or context.' The candidate included a minor HPI detail in the chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate accurately captures the core HPI details: 'Chaz Thomas is here for a follow-up after removing his splint yesterday due to someone else's blood getting on it. He is seeking advice on what to do next.' It slightly rephrases the patient's inquiry but preserves the meaning. It also includes the introductory 'Chaz Thomas is here for a follow-up,' which is present in the transcript but often omitted from HPI. The benchmark provides a more concise HPI focusing only on the specific problem. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate's verbatim extraction 'Laceration clean, dry, and intact with sutures. Sutures removed today, tolerating well without complication. Some pain and limited flexion.' is highly accurate and includes all relevant verbatim details from the transcript, adhering strictly to the instruction. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both the candidate and benchmark correctly state '-' as no imaging results were mentioned for this patient in the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate's assessment ('Laceration healing well', 'Pain with limited flexion') accurately reflects the patient's conditions and aligns well with the instruction to exclude normal or negative findings, which the benchmark partially failed to do. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate included 'Sutures removed today' which was part of the physical exam findings, not explicitly dictated as part of the 'plan' section by the doctor. It also simplified 'Return to clinic in two weeks for follow-up and range of motion check' to 'Follow-up in two weeks,' missing a minor detail. The benchmark more accurately captured only the explicit plan items. |

**Total Score:** 31

**Percentage:** 88.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed very well, demonstrating strong factual accuracy across most fields. It excelled in verbatim extraction for musculoskeletal findings and generated a clinically relevant assessment. Minor deductions were made for including extraneous details in the chief complaint and the plan, where specific sections of dictation should be strictly adhered to. Overall, the note is of high quality and largely aligns with the benchmark.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient name 'Kathy Smith' is accurately identified and extracted, matching the benchmark and transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 0 | The candidate note provides a chief complaint for a different patient (increasing pain and deformity in DIP joints and trapeziometic carpal joints) instead of Kathy Smith's chief complaint of 'Swelling and pain in hand' and 'Follow up for hand surgery'. This is completely incorrect for the specified patient. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The HPI provided in the candidate note pertains to a different patient described earlier in the transcript, not Kathy Smith. It completely misses Kathy Smith's HPI (follow-up, swelling/pain, dissatisfaction with hand therapy, wish to return to Jack). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The musculoskeletal exam findings listed by the candidate note are for a different patient (DIP joint deformity, trapeziometic carpal joint issues) and not for Kathy Smith, whose exam noted 'Incisions well healed. Minimal scar. Some continued tenderness to palpation at the A1 pulley incision. No tendon desquamation at the dorsal hand. Full fist. Moderate soft tissue swelling in the left space especially. Excellent range of motion overall. Some continued pain with motion.' |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The candidate note hallucinates imaging results for Kathy Smith by taking them from another patient's discussion. The transcript indicates no imaging results were discussed for Kathy Smith, and the benchmark correctly reflects this with '-'. The candidate's output is completely irrelevant for this patient. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | The assessments listed ('Bilateral thumb CMC arthritis', 'DIP arthritis', 'Peripheral neuropathy in carpal tunnel') are all conditions pertaining to other patients discussed in the transcript, not Kathy Smith. Kathy Smith's assessment should reflect 'Status post hand surgery', 'Swelling', and 'Pain'. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | While the candidate correctly identifies 'Continue therapy' and 'Follow-up in six weeks' (implied by 'Return to clinic in six weeks'), it incorrectly includes multiple plan items that belong to other patients (e.g., 'Recommend trial of steroid injections', 'Recommend nerve studies and neurology consult'). This indicates a significant failure in patient context, making most of the output irrelevant for Kathy Smith. |

**Total Score:** 6

**Percentage:** 17.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed poorly due to a critical failure in patient identification and context. While it correctly extracted the patient's name, almost all subsequent fields (Chief Complaint, HPI, Musculoskeletal Exam, Imaging Results, Assessment, and most of the Plan) extracted information pertaining to other patients discussed in the long transcript. This severely impacts the clinical utility and accuracy of the note for the intended patient, Kathy Smith.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name 'Nadeem Nemi' is accurately extracted and perfectly matches the benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | The chief complaint 'Bilateral thumb pain' is accurately extracted and perfectly matches the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate note includes details such as 'right-handed male retiree with a history of bilateral carpal tunnel, right cubital tunnel, and bilateral thumb CMC arthritis', which are accurate from the transcript but traditionally fall under Past Medical History or Social History rather than the specific History of Present Illness (HPI) focused on the chief complaint. The benchmark's HPI is more concise and strictly focused on the progression of the bilateral thumb pain, which is typical for an HPI. This constitutes a deviation in scope from the benchmark, even if the information itself is accurate. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The candidate extracted verbatim musculoskeletal exam findings from the transcript. However, the benchmark explicitly states '-' for this field, indicating no content. While the candidate correctly followed its instruction to extract verbatim from the transcript, the discrepancy with the benchmark's empty content is a major difference per the evaluation rubric, as the benchmark is considered the ground truth for what should be in the field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate accurately extracts the imaging findings. Minor wording differences include omitting 'Three view' for the right hand X-rays and summarizing the left hand findings as 'The left hand shows the same findings except for the calcific arteriogram' instead of reconstructing the full description as the benchmark does. However, the meaning is preserved and the summary for the left hand is clinically appropriate given the verbal instruction. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate accurately lists all relevant active problems: 'Bilateral thumb CMC arthritis', 'Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome', and 'Right cubital tunnel syndrome'. It correctly omits 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact', which is a normal finding and generally not included in an assessment list, despite being present in the benchmark. The candidate's output adheres better to the clinical principles for an assessment section. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | The candidate's plan is largely correct but misses a few minor details present in the benchmark. Specifically, it omits 'He understands the procedure will be done today' regarding the injections and the specific condition 'if symptoms re-emerge' for considering nerve studies for carpal/cubital tunnel. These are minor but notable omissions. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.28571428571429

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note demonstrates strong accuracy in extracting basic patient identifiers and chief complaint. It excels in the Assessment section by correctly identifying relevant diagnoses and adhering to best practices for clinical note content. While it accurately extracts information for HPI, Imaging, and Plan, it exhibits minor deviations in scope or detail compared to the benchmark. A notable discrepancy exists in the Musculoskeletal section, where the candidate provides verbatim content from the transcript while the benchmark indicates no content for this field, leading to a significant mismatch for that specific field. Overall, the note is factually accurate based on the transcript but has some areas where its interpretation of section scope or level of detail differs from the human-reviewed benchmark.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The patient's name 'Cathy Smith' is correctly identified and perfectly matches the benchmark and transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 0 | The candidate note's chief complaint ('Increasing pain and deformity in DIP joints and trapeziometic carpal joints') is for the first patient mentioned in the transcript, not Cathy Smith. Cathy Smith's chief complaint, as per the transcript and benchmark, is related to 'Follow up hand pain and swelling'. This is a complete factual inaccuracy for the specified patient. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | The HPI provided by the candidate note is entirely for the first patient discussed in the transcript (DIP joint issues), not Cathy Smith. It also incorrectly includes exam findings, imaging results, and plan details, which are explicitly excluded by the instructions for HPI. This is a complete failure in patient context and instruction adherence. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | The candidate note incorrectly starts with musculoskeletal findings from the first patient ('Diffuse angulation and deformity at DIP joints, moderate tenderness and dislocation'). However, it then correctly and verbatim includes the musculoskeletal findings for Cathy Smith. The inclusion of irrelevant and incorrect patient data constitutes a major content difference, even though part of it is correct. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | The candidate note provides imaging results for Cathy Smith, but these results ('X-rays of both hands demonstrate variable joint space narrowing at DIP joints...') actually pertain to the first patient mentioned in the transcript. For Cathy Smith, no imaging results were dictated, and the benchmark correctly reflects this with '-'. This is a major hallucination of data for the specified patient. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | The candidate note lists assessments ('Bilateral thumb CMC arthritis', 'DIP arthritis') that are relevant to the first patient in the transcript, not Cathy Smith. Cathy Smith's relevant assessment, implied from her HPI, would be 'Hand swelling' and 'Hand pain' as per the benchmark. This is completely incorrect for the specified patient. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | The candidate note incorrectly includes plan items from the first patient's visit ('Trial of steroid injections', 'Discuss DIP fusion', 'Continue splints for pain management') while also including correct elements for Cathy Smith ('Return to clinic in six weeks for follow-up.'). The additional incorrect information from another patient constitutes a major content difference. |

**Total Score:** 7

**Percentage:** 20.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed very poorly due to a consistent and critical error in patient context. While the patient's name was correctly identified, almost all other fields (Chief Complaint, HPI, Imaging Results, Assessment, and parts of Musculoskeletal and Plan) contained information that was entirely irrelevant or factually incorrect for 'Cathy Smith,' instead pulling details from a different patient discussed earlier in the transcript. This demonstrates a severe deficiency in the model's ability to maintain patient-specific context throughout the note generation, leading to significant factual inaccuracies and a failure to adhere to field-specific instructions regarding content relevance and exclusion criteria.

| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | The candidate note provides an accurate summary of the HPI, including the worsening of pain, duration, and lack of numbness/tingling. However, it includes details about the patient's pre-existing conditions (bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, right cubital tunnel syndrome, and bilateral thumb CMC arthritis) which, while factual from the transcript, typically fall under past medical history rather than the strict HPI for the *current* complaint of bilateral thumb pain, as implied by the instruction 'Focus strictly on the patient’s history: onset, duration, location, severity, mechanism of injury, treatments received, and progression of symptoms.' The benchmark was stricter in this regard. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate note accurately extracts the musculoskeletal exam findings verbatim from the transcript, stating 'Bilateral upper extremity skin is clean, dry, and intact.' The benchmark incorrectly stated 'Right upper extremity'. The candidate adheres better to the 'verbatim' instruction and factual accuracy from the transcript. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | The candidate note accurately captures the key imaging findings. However, it omits 'three views' from the description of the right hand X-ray, which was explicitly mentioned in the transcript and included in the benchmark. The rephrasing for the left hand X-rays is acceptable. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate note correctly identifies all relevant active conditions from the transcript, including 'Bilateral thumb CMC arthritis', 'Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome', 'Right cubital tunnel syndrome', and 'Z deformity of the right hand'. It also correctly adheres to the instruction to *not* include normal findings like 'Skin is intact', which the benchmark incorrectly included. This demonstrates superior adherence to instructions and completeness compared to the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate note provides a comprehensive and accurate summary of the doctor's plan, covering injections, observation for carpal and cubital tunnel, consideration of nerve studies, and follow-up. The specificity regarding 'bilateral' and 'right' for the tunnel syndromes is an appropriate contextual addition based on the patient's known history. It aligns very well with the transcript and captures all necessary details. |

**Total Score:** 33

**Percentage:** 94.28

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed exceptionally well, demonstrating high factual accuracy and strong adherence to instructions across most fields. It accurately captured patient identification, chief complaint, musculoskeletal exam details (even correcting a factual error present in the benchmark based on the transcript), and a comprehensive plan. The assessment section was particularly strong, correctly identifying all relevant conditions and adhering to negative constraints better than the benchmark. Minor deductions were made for a slightly broader inclusion of past medical history in the HPI and the omission of a minor detail in the imaging results, but overall, it represents a very high-quality clinical note.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | The candidate note states 'Recurrence of left middle finger trigger finger' while the benchmark states 'Left middle finger trigger finger'. The candidate's version is more specific to the reason for the visit today ('He has had recurrence of his left middle finger trigger finger'), which is factually accurate. The benchmark is a more general diagnosis. This is a minor wording difference, and the meaning is preserved, making it a partial adherence to the benchmark's exact wording but still factually strong. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | The candidate note states 'The patient underwent a left middle finger trigger finger injection on 10-22-24. He reports recurrence of symptoms.' The benchmark includes 'He underwent a left middle finger trigger finger injection on 10-22-24. He has had recurrence of his left middle finger trigger finger. He will return to clinic if he has any recurrence.' The candidate rephrased 'He has had recurrence of his left middle finger trigger finger' to 'He reports recurrence of symptoms,' which loses the specific anatomical location ('left middle finger'). While the candidate correctly omits 'He will return to clinic if he has any recurrence' from HPI (as it is a plan detail), the loss of anatomical specificity in the recurrence description constitutes a missing minor detail. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | The candidate note provides 'The exam findings related to musculoskeletal system were reviewed and remained unchanged.' The benchmark is '-'. The transcript states 'Uh, okay, let's keep the exam the same.' The instruction was to extract 'verbatim' and 'Do not change/modify any thing'. The candidate note completely failed to provide verbatim text and instead fabricated a descriptive sentence, which is a major deviation and hallucination from the specific instruction. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both the candidate note and the benchmark correctly state '-' for imaging results. The transcript indicated 'We can remove the imaging review for the plan,' implying no imaging results were to be documented. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | The candidate note states 'Left middle finger trigger finger (recurrence)' and the benchmark states 'Trigger finger of the left middle finger'. The candidate's assessment is more precise by including '(recurrence)', which is explicitly mentioned and crucial in the transcript ('He has had recurrence of his left middle finger trigger finger'). This makes the candidate note factually more complete and relevant for the current visit while still aligning with the core diagnosis. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | The candidate note states 'Performed left middle finger trigger finger injection today. Patient to return to clinic if recurrence occurs.' The benchmark states 'Left middle finger trigger finger injection. Return to clinic if he has any recurrence.' The candidate note is more accurate and complete by including 'today' as specified in the transcript ('which was performed today'). Both notes accurately capture the follow-up plan. The candidate note is a perfect match and even slightly superior in detail retention. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note performed strongly in fields requiring direct extraction or concise summarization (Patient Name, Imaging Results, Assessment, Plan), often providing precise details from the transcript. However, it significantly failed on the 'MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM' field by fabricating content instead of adhering to the 'verbatim' instruction, resulting in a zero score. The 'HPI_SPENCER' field also showed a minor loss of specificity due to over-summarization. The 'CHIEF_COMPLAINT' was factually correct but varied from the benchmark's more general approach. Overall, the model demonstrates good understanding of clinical context but struggles with strict adherence to 'verbatim' instructions and minor detail retention in more narrative fields.
