  "field_scores": {
    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The patient's name is not mentioned in the provided transcript. The candidate correctly identifies the absence of the name by returning an empty content array with a '-' default, which aligns with the instruction to return '-' if not present. The benchmark includes a name not present in the transcript, which is outside the scope of this evaluation's transcript."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate accurately captures the chief complaint 'numbness and tingling of her right hand' which is directly from the transcript and matches the core meaning of the benchmark."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate provides a well-summarized HPI, capturing most key details regarding the numbness, lymphoma, thumb burn, and phone usage. However, it omits the explicit statements that the patient is 'here for reevaluation' and 'here for evaluation and treatment,' which are part of the initial HPI context given in the transcript."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate fails to adhere to the 'must be verbatim' instruction for this field. It rephrases 'There is triggering there. There is a nodule there.' into 'A nodule and triggering are present' and entirely omits 'A one foley' (likely A1 pulley) which was dictated in the transcript."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate accurately extracts the imaging result 'X-ray is clear' from the transcript and appropriately rephrases it as 'X-ray normal,' which preserves the meaning perfectly. The benchmark's 'XR - Deferred' is inconsistent with the transcript."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate accurately identifies 'Right small finger trigger' and 'Carpal tunnel syndrome' as active problems from the doctor's statements. It also correctly includes 'History of lymphoma,' which is a relevant diagnosis mentioned in the HPI, providing a comprehensive assessment consistent with instructions."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate accurately captures all key elements of the plan from the transcript, presenting them in a concise and appropriate scribe-style summary. The condensation of the trigger finger injection rationale into a clear plan item is consistent with the instruction for a scribe-style summary."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 31,
  "percentage": 88.57,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note performed very well overall, accurately extracting and summarizing most information according to clinical note style. It excelled in the Chief Complaint, Imaging Results, Assessment, and Plan sections, often providing a more complete and appropriate clinical summary than the benchmark for those fields. The primary weakness was in the Musculoskeletal section, where it failed to adhere to the strict 'verbatim' instruction by rephrasing and omitting details. There was also a minor omission of the explicit visit purpose in the HPI."
