    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The patient name 'Sandra Herrara' is not mentioned in the provided transcript. The candidate correctly returned an empty content array with the default '-', aligning with its instructions to not guess. The benchmark's inclusion of a name likely comes from external information not present in this specific transcript, therefore no penalty is applied."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate's 'Lack of relief from previous injection' directly reflects the transcript's 'injection did not offer any relief'. The benchmark's 'Follow up for hand pain' is a more generalized, yet standard, chief complaint. While the candidate's is directly inferable, the benchmark provides a more encompassing and typical chief complaint for a follow-up visit. The meaning is preserved with minor wording and scope differences."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note accurately captures all factual content from the transcript regarding the HPI. Minor wording differences (e.g., 'did not provide any relief' vs 'did not offer any relief', 'seeking further evaluation to determine the cause of her ongoing symptoms' vs 'wants to know what is going on') preserve the original meaning perfectly."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate correctly identifies hypopigmentation and mild tenderness. However, it significantly misrepresents the special tests. The transcript mentions 'positive finger stain' (interpreted as Finkelstein in benchmark) and 'still a positive, um, grind'. The candidate incorrectly combines and mislabels these as 'Positive finger grind test,' completely missing the Finkelstein test and misnaming the Grind test. This constitutes multiple missing/incorrect details."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "No imaging results were mentioned in the transcript. Both the benchmark and candidate correctly reflect this by indicating no content."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The benchmark's 'Pain in hand' is a concise and appropriate problem statement for the assessment. The candidate includes 'No relief from previous injection,' which is a valid active problem. However, it incorrectly includes 'Positive finger grind test,' which is an exam finding and should not be listed as an assessment problem. This indicates a misunderstanding of clinical note structure for this section."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The candidate followed its instruction to provide verbatim content for 'dig verban's injection', but the benchmark correctly identifies this as 'de Quervain's injection', which is medically accurate. As the benchmark is the ground truth, the candidate's verbatim retention of a medically inaccurate term is a factual error from a clinical perspective. The candidate also omitted 'Her previous injection offered no relief' which the benchmark included as a key point in the plan, even if it's a rationale rather than a direct action."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 26,
  "percentage": 74.28,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated strong performance in accurately extracting History of Present Illness details and correctly identifying the absence of patient name and imaging results. However, it struggled significantly with the Musculoskeletal exam findings, exhibiting errors in identifying and labeling specific tests. The Assessment section also showed weaknesses by including an exam finding as a problem. Furthermore, in the Plan section, while adhering to verbatim extraction instructions, it failed to correct a medically inaccurate term dictated by the doctor, which the human-reviewed benchmark appropriately rectified. This highlights a need for improved clinical interpretation and adherence to medical accuracy, even when specific instructions emphasize verbatim transcription."
