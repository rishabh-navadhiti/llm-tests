      "justification": "The patient's name 'Greta Griswana' is perfectly matched in factual content."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The benchmark includes 'Forearm pain, thumb pain'. The candidate only listed 'Thumb pain', missing 'forearm pain' which was mentioned as being better but still a part of her complaints."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate's HPI incorrectly includes objective exam findings ('On examination...', 'positive grind test...', 'No tenderness...', 'some tenderness...') and imaging results ('X-rays reveal planned arthritis, and a steroid injection is recommended'). The instructions explicitly state: 'Do NOT include any exam findings, physical measurements, imaging results, or other objective observations.' Additionally, the candidate missed crucial HPI information present in the transcript and benchmark, specifically about the daughter's wedding and how it affected her pain ('her daughter's wedding was this weekend, and so she did not have to do a lot with her hand and the pain is better, but overall it is the same.'). This is a major instruction violation and content difference."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The instruction requires verbatim extraction. The candidate rephrased and omitted details. For example, 'Significant tendinous location' and 'imminence' were omitted. 'Right upper termine' was changed to 'right thumb', and 'with' was changed to 'at' for A1 pulley and U&R, which deviates from the verbatim requirement."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The candidate provided 'X-rays show planned arthritis.' The benchmark has 'X-rays reviewed. It shows planned arthritis.' While the candidate slightly rephrased 'X-rays reviewed. It'll be planned arthritis' from the transcript, the meaning is preserved, and it's a minor wording difference."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The benchmark correctly identifies 'Planned arthritis' as the assessment. The candidate included 'Thumb pain' (a symptom) and 'Positive grind test at trapeziometacarpal joint' (an exam finding) in the assessment. While symptoms can sometimes be included, an exam finding is generally not part of the assessment problem list, even with the given instruction 'Keep terms short and scribe-style, without exam details or explanations.' The inclusion of an exam detail as an assessment item is a deviation from clinical note standards for this section."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate note accurately captured all elements of the plan from the transcript, including the specific follow-up details ('for follow-up if symptoms persist'), which the benchmark slightly condensed. This is a perfect match and even more complete than the benchmark in this specific detail, while adhering to the instructions."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 23,
  "percentage": 65.71,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated proficiency in extracting the patient's name and the treatment plan details. However, it exhibited significant weaknesses in adhering to specific field instructions, particularly for the HPI section, where objective findings were incorrectly included and subjective historical information was omitted. The verbatim requirement for the musculoskeletal exam was not met, and the assessment included an inappropriate exam finding. Overall, the note shows inconsistent quality with good performance on direct extractions but struggles with semantic understanding and adherence to formatting rules for structured fields like HPI and Musculoskeletal exam."
