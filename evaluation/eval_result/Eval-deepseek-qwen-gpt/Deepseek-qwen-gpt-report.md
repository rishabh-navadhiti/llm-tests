# REC-6602

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | Patient name appears in the benchmark ('Linda Omansky') but is not present in the transcript; not penalized for missing name. However, the candidate should have returned '-' per instructions and instead left the field empty. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Matches benchmark meaning ('Numbness and tingling in the right hand') with only trivial wording differences. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Accurately captures all key elements from the transcript (recent lymphoma chemotherapy completion, increased numbness/tingling in right hand, burned right thumb affecting sensation/earrings, using phone less, here for evaluation). No added or missing clinically relevant details. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Not verbatim: paraphrases and edits wording, omits 'A1 pulley' (stated as 'A one foley' in transcript), alters phrasing for triggering/nodule, and changes '.pcgs/.PCTS' to 'PCGs are normal.' Multiple deviations from dictated text. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | Benchmark states 'XR - Deferred.' Candidate reports 'X-ray normal,' which conflicts with the benchmark result. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Benchmark lists only 'Trigger finger.' Candidate adds 'Carpal tunnel syndrome' and 'History of lymphoma,' which are not in the benchmark assessment; includes extra/unconfirmed problems. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Plan elements match the benchmark: repeat injection for right small finger, night splints for carpal tunnel, low threshold for nerve studies, and return in two months. Minor wording differences only. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captures the chief complaint, HPI, and plan, aligning closely with the benchmark on those sections. Major weaknesses include non-verbatim musculoskeletal exam documentation, imaging results that contradict the benchmark, and an assessment with unsupported additions. The patient name field was left empty instead of using the required '-' when not present in the transcript.

# REC-6604

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | Candidate lists 'Nicole Coffee' from the transcript, while the benchmark corrects this to 'Nicole Kaffee.' Minor spelling discrepancy; not heavily penalized as the corrected spelling is not explicit in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Meaning matches benchmark ('Left index finger pain') with only minor wording differences. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures duration, location, worsening course, prior shoulder visit, and request for injection. Omits the detail that the prior doctor recommended observation, which is present in the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Includes most elements but differs from benchmark wording (e.g., 'tacky' vs 'intact', 'walking catching' vs benchmark 'locking and catching') and adds 'Able to give a thumbs up,' which the benchmark excluded. Multiple minor deviations from the benchmark phrasing. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Conveys normal X-rays but omits specifics in the benchmark ('three views,' 'left index finger'). Core finding is correct with missing details. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes 'left index finger pain' and trigger-related diagnosis, consistent with benchmark. Adds an exam finding ('tenderness at A1 pulley') not listed as an assessment item in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Correctly includes plan for trigger finger injection today, aligning with benchmark. Also includes imaging result within the plan, which is extra relative to the benchmark’s plan content. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14285714285715

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captures the main clinical details, including the chief complaint, HPI, and the plan for trigger finger injection. Minor omissions (e.g., prior observation recommendation) and wording mismatches are present, particularly in the musculoskeletal exam. Imaging results are correct but less specific than the benchmark. One organizational issue is inclusion of imaging findings within the plan. Overall, the note is largely accurate with a few detail and phrasing gaps.

# REC-6605

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Both notes correctly return '-' as the patient's name is not stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | Benchmark specifies 'Left small finger locking and catching.' Candidate states 'Evaluation of left small finger,' omitting the key symptoms of locking and catching. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Matches the benchmark’s factual content: right-hand dominant designer, left small finger locking/catching for ~2 years, delayed care due to prior trigger finger surgeries, now seeking evaluation. No extraneous inferences. The benchmark’s added job impact is not required from the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Contains core elements (skin purging, no erythema, tenderness, nodule, excellent ROM, well-healed incisions) but is not verbatim and introduces a non-dictated location ('metacarpophalangeal joint') and awkward phrasing ('triggering excellent range of motion'). This deviates from the dictated phrasing and adds a minor hallucination. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Conveys normal X-ray findings consistent with the benchmark; minor wording differences only. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Correctly lists 'Trigger finger (left small finger)' but adds 'Status post trigger finger surgery (middle finger)' despite no ongoing issue being described; the benchmark does not include this. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Accurately captures the planned trigger finger procedure. The benchmark includes a 2-week follow-up, which is not stated in the transcript; per instructions, this omission is not penalized. Wording ('surgery' vs 'release') is a minor difference with preserved meaning. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note aligns well with the benchmark on HPI, imaging, and the core plan, and correctly leaves the patient name blank. The chief complaint is overly generic and misses the key symptoms. The musculoskeletal section is not verbatim and introduces a minor hallucination. Assessment includes an unnecessary 'status post' item. Overall, clinically reasonable with some fidelity and specificity issues.

# REC-6607

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Transcript does not state the patient's name; candidate appropriately did not invent one. Benchmark includes a name likely from chart—no penalty for info absent from transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Benchmark: 'Wrist pain.' Candidate added 'interest in total wrist arthroplasty,' which is accurate but extends beyond a pure chief complaint; meaning preserved. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Captures knee replacement, improved synovitis after injection, osteoporosis infusion, wrist pain, and interest in right wrist arthroplasty. Minor inaccuracies/omissions: 'injections' (plural), no 'right' side, omits follow-up context ('here for evaluation and treatment'). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Transcript only states 'Exam mostly unchanged' with no specific MSK findings verbatim. Candidate added 'Bilateral wrist arthritis,' which is not a dictated exam finding. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | Transcript indicates imaging unchanged ('leave all the same'); benchmark notes 'Imaging mostly unchanged.' Candidate provided no imaging result, omitting available content. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes 'Bilateral wrist arthritis' and 'Synovitis' (benchmark items) and adds 'Osteoporosis,' which is supported by transcript. Minor wording variation ('improved') but clinically consistent. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Accurately notes plan for right total wrist arthroplasty. Adds 'Follow-up as needed,' which is not dictated, and omits phrasing like 'Plan OR risks/We will proceed.' Partial adherence. |

**Total Score:** 22

**Percentage:** 62.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the core clinical narrative—wrist pain with interest in right total wrist arthroplasty, improved synovitis after injection, and osteoporosis infusion—but misses or alters several specifics. Strengths include generally accurate HPI and assessment. Weaknesses include adding non-dictated elements (MSK exam finding, follow-up), omitting imaging status, and minor inaccuracies in HPI details.

# REC-6608

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | Patient name is not present in the transcript; the candidate appropriately did not invent a name. However, they left the content empty instead of returning '-' as specified, which is a minor formatting deviation. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Candidate states 'Lack of relief from previous injection,' which is explicitly supported by the transcript. The benchmark lists 'Follow up for hand pain,' which is not explicitly stated in the transcript. Meaning is reasonably preserved, but it does not match the benchmark phrasing. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Accurately paraphrases the transcript: prior injection provided no relief and the patient wants evaluation/answers. No extraneous details added. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Key elements were altered/omitted: 'Positive Finkelstein' is missing, and 'Still a positive Grind' was changed to 'Positive finger grind test.' Wording is not verbatim and one finding is omitted. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | No imaging mentioned in transcript; benchmark shows '-'. Candidate left the content empty instead of returning '-', a minor formatting issue. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark assessment is 'Pain in hand.' Candidate lists 'No relief from previous injection' and an exam sign ('Positive finger grind test'), which are not appropriate problem statements and omit 'hand pain.' |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Captures the key plan items: trial injection and 6-week follow-up. Spelling reflects transcript mispronunciation ('dig verban's'), and it omits the benchmark's non-action statement that prior injection gave no relief. Overall meaning preserved with minor omissions. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57142857142857

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captured the HPI and the core elements of the plan, but had shortcomings in the musculoskeletal exam (non-verbatim wording and omitted finding) and the assessment (inclusion of an exam sign and omission of 'hand pain'). Minor formatting issues were present for patient name and imaging. Overall, clinically relevant content was mostly preserved, but precision and adherence to verbatim/section conventions need improvement.

# REC-6610

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark and explicitly stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Core complaint 'Left wrist pain' matches; added mechanism ('after a trip and fall') is extra but accurate. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures onset, mechanism, date, urgent care visit with negative X-rays/sprain diagnosis, and worsening in Massachusetts; omits minor detail ('while leaving Groundlings') and paraphrases humidity-related worsening. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Largely verbatim MSK exam findings for the left wrist; however, it includes an imaging statement ('X-rays are normal') which is not part of the MSK exam. Benchmark left this field empty, but the transcript supports the included exam details. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Includes current left wrist X-rays normal; misses benchmark detail that urgent care X-rays previously showed no fracture. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Lists 'Left ECU tendonitis' and 'Left ulnar-sided wrist pain' exactly as in the benchmark; excludes unrelated normals. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark plan: hand therapy trial, MRI for further evaluation, and return after MRI. |

**Total Score:** 30

**Percentage:** 85.71428571428571

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely aligns with the benchmark for patient identification, assessment, and plan. HPI is accurate with minor omissions/paraphrasing. Chief complaint includes a small extra detail. Musculoskeletal exam is largely verbatim but includes an imaging statement. Imaging results are correct but incomplete compared to the benchmark. Overall, strong fidelity with a few minor discrepancies.

# REC-6612

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Transcript does not state a name; candidate correctly returned '-'. Benchmark includes a name not present in the transcript, which should not be penalized. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | Benchmark: follow-up for wrist achiness and limited motion. Candidate: wrist pain and numbness/tingling. Misses 'follow-up' and 'limited motion' while adding tingling; multiple deviations from the benchmark focus. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Captures stable wrist pain/limited motion and electric sensations with use, consistent with transcript. Omits several benchmark details (doing okay overall, life is difficult, nerve studies completed, and inquiry about results). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | No specific MSK findings were dictated beyond 'exam unchanged'; benchmark leaves this section empty. Candidate appropriately left it empty. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Candidate lists nerve study findings (no carpal tunnel; possible ulnar nerve compression at Guyon's canal) exactly as in transcript. Benchmark is generic ('Nerve study results'); meaning preserved but not an exact match. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Benchmark assessment includes wrist pain, electric sensations, and limited wrist motion. Candidate includes wrist pain and numbness/tingling (aligns with electric sensations) but omits limited motion and adds possible ulnar nerve compression not listed in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Includes review nerve studies, advanced activity, urology consult, and 6-week follow-up. Misses several benchmark items: delete carpal tunnel diagnosis, monitor ulnar compression, advanced weightbearing phrasing, and disability plan (full duty 9/1/2025). Also uses 'urology' vs benchmark 'neurology'. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures key HPI elements and nerve study findings, and parts of the plan, but omits multiple benchmark details (notably in HPI and plan) and diverges in chief complaint focus. Strengths include accurate extraction of nerve study results and appropriate handling of absent patient name and MSK exam. Weaknesses are incomplete plan documentation and partial alignment with the benchmark assessment and chief complaint.

# REC-6613

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to the benchmark and explicitly stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Identical to the benchmark: 'Left wrist pain and masses.' |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Captures key elements (night pain, mass locations, right-hand dominance, Dr. Ishimori) but omits that the masses used to fluctuate and that the rheumatologist ordered X-rays and ultrasound; states masses are constant without noting prior fluctuation. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark is empty, while the candidate provides paraphrased exam findings and omits several dictated elements (e.g., negative Finkelstein, no pain with resisted thumb extension). Not verbatim per instruction and does not match the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Factual content matches the benchmark (X-ray osteophyte at thumb MCP; ultrasound bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte at dorsal MCP; wrist ultrasound retinacular cyst). Only minor wording differences. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes two benchmark diagnoses (left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte) and pain, but differs from 'Bilateral hand pain' and omits other benchmark items ('Skin is intact', 'No tenderness to palpation'). Note: not penalizing for any benchmark details not clearly available in the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Includes core elements (night splints, observe masses, consider aspiration vs biopsy, 6-week follow-up) but adds unsubstantiated qualifiers ('for carpal tunnel syndrome', 'if symptoms worsen') not present in the benchmark or transcript. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captured the patient name, chief complaint, and imaging findings. The HPI was mostly correct but missed prior size fluctuation and the rheumatologist’s imaging orders. The musculoskeletal exam was not verbatim and included omissions relative to the transcript and did not match the blank benchmark field. The assessment captured key diagnoses but missed additional benchmark items. The plan matched the main actions but included unsupported qualifiers. Overall, good core accuracy with notable omissions and minor additions.

# REC-6614

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark name as stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Meaningfully identical to benchmark ('Left wrist pain'); minor wording ('Evaluation of') does not change the content. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures all key HPI details and chronology; minor omission of the location nuance ('front/anterior' of the wrist) from imaging context. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark is '-', while candidate provides detailed exam text; this is a major mismatch with the ground truth for this field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Fully matches benchmark imaging findings (thumb MCP osteophyte; bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte; retinacular cyst superficial to first dorsal compartment). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes core problems (left wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte, bilateral thumb/MCP masses). Omits benchmark items 'skin intact' and 'no tenderness to palpation' (exam negatives not clearly required by transcript) and adds 'left wrist pain'; overall content closely aligns. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Contains the main plan elements (observation, aspiration vs biopsy, 6-week follow-up). However, incorrectly attributes night splints to carpal tunnel rather than 'regarding the masses' per benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for name, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging. Assessment aligns with the main conditions but includes a minor extra and misses benchmark exam negatives. The plan mostly matches but misattributes the indication for night splints. Musculoskeletal field diverges from the benchmark, which is blank in the ground truth.

# REC-6622

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | Name matches but candidate included the honorific 'Mr.', while the benchmark lists just 'Kevin Clancy'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'Left ring finger trigger finger'. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures the condition accurately and adds injection scheduling details from the transcript; minor deviation from the benchmark’s succinct phrasing. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Benchmark has no MSK exam data; candidate incorrectly listed 'Plantar tendonitis' (a diagnosis, not a verbatim MSK exam finding). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging results for this patient are in the transcript; candidate correctly returned '-'. (The 'shuttered vein' note pertains to a different patient.) |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes both problems but 'Trigger finger' lacks the benchmark’s specificity (left ring finger). 'Plantar tendonitis' matches. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Included HEP and low threshold for therapy, but omitted the trigger finger injection mentioned in the transcript. Not penalized for missing 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks' since it is not in the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 23

**Percentage:** 65.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate captured the chief complaint and much of the HPI accurately and handled imaging appropriately. However, it misused the Musculoskeletal field, underspecified the assessment by omitting laterality/digit, and notably missed the injection component of the plan.

# REC-6625

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 4 | Name correct but includes the honorific 'Mr.' whereas the benchmark lists just 'Parviz Mikael'; minor formatting difference. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Candidate chose 'Wants to know what is going on' while the benchmark uses 'No pain.' Both are stated in the transcript, but it misses the benchmark’s selected complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Matches benchmark content and adds 'here for follow-up' directly from the transcript without adding forbidden elements. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Reflects the dictated exam content accurately; minor filler words present but factual content aligns with the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'X-rays are the same as the last time.' |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Benchmark lists 'No tenderness to palpation' and 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' The candidate instead lists 'Stiff fingers' and a plan item ('Plexal ligament split'). Note: 'Skin is intact' is not stated in the transcript and is not penalized, but omission of 'no tenderness' and inclusion of a treatment term reduce accuracy. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Captures all plan elements from the benchmark (continue plexal ligament split, review X-rays, likely pin removal or repeat X-rays, transition to phenylplastic splint, referral to Eliza Cherian, and RTC in 10 days) with only minor wording differences. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark in HPI, MSK exam, imaging, and plan. Minor formatting differences in the patient name and a different selection for chief complaint lowered those sections slightly. The main discrepancy is in the assessment, where the candidate omitted the benchmark’s problems and added a treatment item, reducing alignment. Overall, strong performance with most clinically relevant content correctly captured.

# REC-6627

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | The transcript does not state the patient's name; candidate appropriately left it unspecified as per instructions. Do not penalize for benchmark-only information. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Meaning matches benchmark exactly: bilateral hand numbness, tingling, and burning pain. Minor phrasing/case differences only. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately captures onset (around July 1, 2025), symptoms, pregnancy context, and splinting with night symptoms. Omits OB referral/recommendation and occupational detail present in benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Content broadly similar but not verbatim: missing '.PCTS', changes wording ('Some' omitted, singular vs plural), and merges lines. Field requires exact dictated phrasing. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Matches benchmark exactly: X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes correct diagnosis and adds relevant symptom/finding items from the transcript. Extra items are accurate but exceed benchmark’s concise list. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Captures injections today with risks/temporary nature and 3-month postpartum follow-up if persistent. Omits the note about splints/lack of improvement included in benchmark plan. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely aligns with the benchmark on chief complaint, imaging, and overall plan. The HPI is strong but misses the OB referral detail. The assessment is accurate but more expansive than the benchmark. The main shortfall is the musculoskeletal section, which is not verbatim and omits '.PCTS'. Overall, clinically accurate with minor omissions and formatting deviations.

| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes exam/imaging/plan details (positive grind, X-rays, steroid recommendation) that should not be in HPI and omits contextual detail present in the benchmark (e.g., daughter's wedding, pain overall the same). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Not verbatim: omits 'Right upper extremity' and 'Significant tendinous location', changes 'very positive grind' to 'positive grind', and alters phrasing ('with' A1 pulley, 'U&R imminence'). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Matches benchmark content that X-rays were reviewed and show 'planned arthritis' (minor wording only). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes correct diagnosis 'Planned arthritis' but also adds a symptom and an exam finding not present in the benchmark assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Accurately captures the dictated plan: trial steroid injection, counseling on temporary nature/procedure/post-op protocol, and return in 8 weeks if symptoms persist. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly identifies the patient, imaging result, and plan. However, the HPI includes objective findings and misses benchmark context, the chief complaint omits forearm pain, and the musculoskeletal section is not verbatim with several wording omissions/changes. Assessment contains the correct diagnosis but includes extra items not in the benchmark.

# REC-6635

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Benchmark lists a name, but the transcript does not state the patient's name. Candidate appropriately did not invent a name (returned no name), which is acceptable given the transcript-only constraint. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Exact match in meaning with the benchmark: 'Index finger pain and stiffness.' |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Core history (mechanism, date 7/16/25, urgent care repair, suture removal ~14 days later with wound reopening, current stiffness/pain) matches. Minor omissions: the specific occupational detail (miniatures for stop-motion) and descriptive qualifiers like 'dorsal/PIP' not included. No incorrect additions. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Content substantially matches (well-healing laceration, very stiff index finger PIP with ~10° active flexion, moderate swelling, no tenderness, remaining digits with excellent ROM). Minor wording differences ('no sensory tenderness' vs 'no specific tenderness', 'digit' vs 'digits', omission of 'at this time') prevent a perfect verbatim match. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Matches benchmark and transcript: X-rays are normal. Minor phrasing difference is acceptable. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Captures the two active problems (index finger laceration and stiffness). Minor deviations from benchmark include omission of laterality and adding 'PIP' wording, but no false conditions. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Correctly includes hand therapy and return in 4 weeks, but incorrectly adds 'for follow-up imaging,' which is not in the benchmark or clearly supported by the transcript. This constitutes a minor hallucination. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.85714285714286

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note aligns well with the benchmark on chief complaint, imaging, and most of the HPI and exam. Minor omissions and wording differences appear in HPI and musculoskeletal sections. The main deficiency is in the plan, where 'follow-up imaging' was added incorrectly. No unjustified name was introduced, adhering to transcript constraints.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match with benchmark: 'Kathy Smith' is correctly extracted from the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | Candidate lists 'increasing pain and deformity in DIP and trapeziometacarpal joints,' which pertains to a different patient. Benchmark chief complaints are 'Swelling and pain in hand' and 'Follow up for hand surgery' for Kathy Smith. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | Content describes another patient's DIP arthritis and includes exam-style details. Benchmark HPI for Kathy is follow-up, doing okay overall, persistent swelling/pain, and dissatisfaction with therapy wanting to return to Jack. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Candidate provides exam findings from a different patient (DIP deformities, trapeziometacarpal tenderness) and paraphrases rather than verbatim. Benchmark shows post-op findings: incisions well healed, minimal scar, A1 pulley incision tenderness, no tendon desquamation at dorsal hand, full fist, moderate swelling (left), excellent ROM, pain with motion. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | Benchmark indicates no imaging for Kathy ('-'). Candidate includes hand X-ray findings from another case, which is incorrect for this visit. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | Candidate lists 'bilateral thumb CMC arthritis,' 'DIP arthritis,' and 'peripheral neuropathy,' which are from other patients. Benchmark assessment for Kathy is 'Status post hand surgery,' 'Swelling,' and 'Pain.' |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Candidate mixes plans from multiple patients (steroid injections, DIP fusion, nerve studies, neurology consult, night splints). Only 'Continue therapy' and 'Follow-up in six weeks' match. It omits 'Return to Jack for hand therapy.' |

**Total Score:** 8

**Percentage:** 22.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly identifies the patient name but largely conflates details from multiple patients in the transcript. Chief complaint, HPI, exam, imaging, and assessment do not reflect Kathy Smith's visit. The plan contains some correct elements but is diluted by irrelevant interventions from other cases. Greater focus on patient-specific segmentation is needed.

| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Candidate partially echoes the benchmark exam but adds unrelated findings from another patient (DIP deformities) and paraphrases rather than verbatim (e.g., omits 'in the left space especially'). Instruction required verbatim extraction. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | Benchmark indicates no imaging for this visit ('-'). Candidate provides hand X-ray findings from a different patient segment, making this incorrect. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | Benchmark assessment is symptom-based ('Hand swelling', 'Hand pain'). Candidate lists 'Bilateral thumb CMC arthritis' and 'DIP arthritis' from another patient, not matching the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Candidate includes the correct follow-up ('Return to clinic in six weeks') but adds unrelated plans (steroid injections, DIP fusion, splints) from another patient. Benchmark plan is 'Continue therapy. Transition care with Jack. Return in 6 weeks.' |

**Total Score:** 10

**Percentage:** 28.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly captured the patient name and the follow-up interval but largely mixed content from another patient encounter. Chief complaint, HPI, imaging, assessment, and most of the plan are incorrect relative to the benchmark. The musculoskeletal exam contains partial overlap but is not verbatim and includes extraneous findings.

# REC-6645

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark ('Nadeem Nemi') and explicitly stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Exact match to benchmark ('Bilateral thumb pain') with no extraneous details. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Fully aligns with the benchmark’s factual content (worsening since 2019, worse over last 6 months, denies numbness/tingling, pain limiting function). Additional contextual details (right-handed retiree, prior conditions) are accurate and from the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Content largely matches, but candidate states 'Bilateral upper extremity' whereas the benchmark specifies 'Right upper extremity.' This is a factual side discrepancy despite otherwise matching phrasing. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Core findings match the benchmark (severe joint space neovasculitis, metacarpal osteophytosis, Z deformity, calcific arteriogram noted on right only). Minor omissions/wording differences (omits 'three views') prevent a perfect score. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes key diagnoses matching the benchmark (bilateral thumb CMC arthritis, bilateral carpal tunnel, right cubital tunnel) but omits the benchmark item 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' and adds 'Z deformity of the right hand,' which is not listed in the benchmark assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches the benchmark plan: steroid injections with counseling on temporary effect/rebound pain, observation for carpal/cubital tunnel, consider nerve studies, and follow-up in 2 months. Only minor phrasing differences. |

**Total Score:** 30

**Percentage:** 85.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark, particularly for patient name, chief complaint, HPI, and plan. Minor discrepancies include side designation in the musculoskeletal exam, omission of 'three views' in imaging, and assessment list differences (missing a benchmark item and adding an extra one). Overall, factual content is strong with small variances.

# REC-6682

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match with benchmark: 'N. Kalinski' appears verbatim in both. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Content aligns (left middle finger trigger finger) with added 'recurrence' descriptor. Clinically accurate but not a perfect match to benchmark phrasing. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Includes prior injection date (10-22-24) and recurrence, matching benchmark core facts. Omits the follow-up statement included in benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark has no MSK exam content ('-'), while candidate paraphrases 'exam the same' rather than providing verbatim text or leaving blank. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both indicate no imaging results reported ('-'), consistent with transcript note to remove imaging review. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Diagnosis matches (left middle finger trigger finger); candidate adds '(recurrence)'. Accurate but not an exact match to benchmark wording. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark plan: injection performed today and return to clinic if recurrence occurs. |

**Total Score:** 28

**Percentage:** 80

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark on name, imaging, and plan, with accurate content for chief complaint, HPI, and assessment but minor wording differences. The main deficiency is the musculoskeletal section, which should have been left blank/verbatim rather than paraphrased.
