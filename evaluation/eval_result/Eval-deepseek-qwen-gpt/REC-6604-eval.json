      "justification": "Captures duration, location, worsening course, prior shoulder visit, and request for injection. Omits the detail that the prior doctor recommended observation, which is present in the benchmark."

      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Includes most elements but differs from benchmark wording (e.g., 'tacky' vs 'intact', 'walking catching' vs benchmark 'locking and catching') and adds 'Able to give a thumbs up,' which the benchmark excluded. Multiple minor deviations from the benchmark phrasing."

    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {

    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 4,

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note accurately captures the main clinical details, including the chief complaint, HPI, and the plan for trigger finger injection. Minor omissions (e.g., prior observation recommendation) and wording mismatches are present, particularly in the musculoskeletal exam. Imaging results are correct but less specific than the benchmark. One organizational issue is inclusion of imaging findings within the plan. Overall, the note is largely accurate with a few detail and phrasing gaps."
