      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Captures the key plan items: trial injection and 6-week follow-up. Spelling reflects transcript mispronunciation ('dig verban's'), and it omits the benchmark's non-action statement that prior injection gave no relief. Overall meaning preserved with minor omissions."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note accurately captured the HPI and the core elements of the plan, but had shortcomings in the musculoskeletal exam (non-verbatim wording and omitted finding) and the assessment (inclusion of an exam sign and omission of 'hand pain'). Minor formatting issues were present for patient name and imaging. Overall, clinically relevant content was mostly preserved, but precision and adherence to verbatim/section conventions need improvement."
