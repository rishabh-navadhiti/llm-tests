      "justification": "Largely verbatim MSK exam findings for the left wrist; however, it includes an imaging statement ('X-rays are normal') which is not part of the MSK exam. Benchmark left this field empty, but the transcript supports the included exam details."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely aligns with the benchmark for patient identification, assessment, and plan. HPI is accurate with minor omissions/paraphrasing. Chief complaint includes a small extra detail. Musculoskeletal exam is largely verbatim but includes an imaging statement. Imaging results are correct but incomplete compared to the benchmark. Overall, strong fidelity with a few minor discrepancies."
