      "justification": "Candidate chose 'Wants to know what is going on' while the benchmark uses 'No pain.' Both are stated in the transcript, but it misses the benchmark’s selected complaint."

      "score": 5,

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Benchmark lists 'No tenderness to palpation' and 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' The candidate instead lists 'Stiff fingers' and a plan item ('Plexal ligament split'). Note: 'Skin is intact' is not stated in the transcript and is not penalized, but omission of 'no tenderness' and inclusion of a treatment term reduce accuracy."

      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Captures all plan elements from the benchmark (continue plexal ligament split, review X-rays, likely pin removal or repeat X-rays, transition to phenylplastic splint, referral to Eliza Cherian, and RTC in 10 days) with only minor wording differences."

  "total_score": 29,
  "percentage": 82.86,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark in HPI, MSK exam, imaging, and plan. Minor formatting differences in the patient name and a different selection for chief complaint lowered those sections slightly. The main discrepancy is in the assessment, where the candidate omitted the benchmark’s problems and added a treatment item, reducing alignment. Overall, strong performance with most clinically relevant content correctly captured."
