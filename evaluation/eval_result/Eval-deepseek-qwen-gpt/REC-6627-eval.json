      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Accurately captures onset (around July 1, 2025), symptoms, pregnancy context, and splinting with night symptoms. Omits OB referral/recommendation and occupational detail present in benchmark."

    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Content broadly similar but not verbatim: missing '.PCTS', changes wording ('Some' omitted, singular vs plural), and merges lines. Field requires exact dictated phrasing."

      "score": 5,

  "total_score": 29,
  "percentage": 82.86,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely aligns with the benchmark on chief complaint, imaging, and overall plan. The HPI is strong but misses the OB referral detail. The assessment is accurate but more expansive than the benchmark. The main shortfall is the musculoskeletal section, which is not verbatim and omits '.PCTS'. Overall, clinically accurate with minor omissions and formatting deviations."
