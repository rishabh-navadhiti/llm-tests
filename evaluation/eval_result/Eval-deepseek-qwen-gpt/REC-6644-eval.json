      "justification": "Candidate HPI mixes another patient's issues (DIP/TMC arthritis) and includes exam, imaging, and plan details, while benchmark HPI states follow-up status, ongoing swelling/pain, dissatisfaction with therapy, and desire to return to Jack. Content and scope do not match."

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Candidate partially echoes the benchmark exam but adds unrelated findings from another patient (DIP deformities) and paraphrases rather than verbatim (e.g., omits 'in the left space especially'). Instruction required verbatim extraction."

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Candidate includes the correct follow-up ('Return to clinic in six weeks') but adds unrelated plans (steroid injections, DIP fusion, splints) from another patient. Benchmark plan is 'Continue therapy. Transition care with Jack. Return in 6 weeks.'"

Chief complaint, HPI, imaging, assessment, and most of the plan are incorrect relative to the benchmark. The musculoskeletal exam contains partial overlap but is not verbatim and includes extraneous findings."
