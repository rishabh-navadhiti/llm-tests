  "field_scores": {
    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "The candidate note completely missed the patient's name, which is present in the benchmark note. While the name 'Linda Omansky' is not in the provided transcript, the benchmark includes it, making its absence a critical factual omission for a clinical note."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The candidate perfectly matched the benchmark's chief complaint, 'Numbness and tingling in the right hand', and adhered to the instruction to provide only the complaint without additional details."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate's output for HPI is fundamentally different in structure and content from the benchmark. While it followed its own internal instruction to list onset, duration, location, and severity, this resulted in a major content difference compared to the benchmark's comprehensive narrative HPI. Key details like the re-evaluation reason, burned thumb, difficulty feeling, and trying to hold the phone less are missing. Additionally, 'Severity: Moderate' is a hallucination not present in the transcript."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The candidate failed to adhere strictly to the 'verbatim' instruction. It missed 'to palpation' and 'A1 pulley' for tenderness, combined 'triggering' and 'nodule' into one rephrased sentence, and included 'X-ray is clear' which, as per the benchmark's structure, belongs in the 'IMAGING_RESULTS' section. There is also a minor difference in the 'PCGs' vs 'PCTS' part compared to the benchmark."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate stated 'X-ray is clear.' based on the transcript. However, the benchmark note explicitly states 'XR - Deferred.' These two statements have significantly different clinical meanings, representing a major content difference from the benchmark."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The candidate's assessment lists symptoms ('Right hand numbness and tingling', 'Right thumb burn injury', 'Right small finger trigger nodule') while the benchmark provides a concise diagnosis ('Trigger finger.'). This constitutes a major content difference and a deviation from the benchmark's expected output for this field."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The candidate captured the core treatment plan points accurately (injection, splints, nerve studies, follow-up). However, it missed some conversational details and reasoning provided in the benchmark regarding the trigger finger injection (last injection date, patient's request, doctor's agreement), which the candidate's own instructions asked for ('reflect how the provider explains the reasoning behind the treatment'). This constitutes missing minor details and partial adherence to instructions."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 13,
  "percentage": 37.14,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note demonstrated significant weaknesses in several critical areas when compared to the benchmark. Fields like PATIENT_NAME, HPI_SPENCER, IMAGING_RESULTS, and ASSESSMENT_SPENCER showed major content discrepancies, either due to missing information, hallucination, or a fundamental difference in how information was structured or interpreted. While the CHIEF_COMPLAINT was perfect, and the PLAN_SPENCER_ captured the main points, the overall adherence to the benchmark's detailed structure and content, as well as the 'verbatim' instruction for musculoskeletal findings, was poor. The model struggles when its internal instructions lead to outputs that diverge from the established 'golden standard' clinical note format."
