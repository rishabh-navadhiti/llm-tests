She has been at home more because of this and has noticed increasing numbness and tingling of her, uh, right hand. She states that she also burned her right thumb and therefore, uh, it is much more difficult to feel, uh, things and put her earrings on. She has been trying to hold her phone less. She is here for evaluation and treatment. On exam, uh, bilateral upper extremty skin is clean, dry and intact without erythema or ecchymosis. Moderate tenderness of the right small finger. A one foley. There is triggering there. There is a nodule there. Um, excellent range of motion overall. Uh,.pcgs are normal. Let me see if we did have this one. X-ray is clear. Plan B regarding the trigger. Her last injection in her right small finger was in 2015. She would like another today. I think this is reasonable. And then, um, plan carpal tunnel recommend night splints, low threshold for nerve studies. Return to clinic in two months for follow-up.",
