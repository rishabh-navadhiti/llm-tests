            "conversation": "Hold on one second. Um, Miss Stephanie Humphrey, who is a right hand dominant, um, horticulturalist. She is status post trip and fall on 6/21/25. She presents today for evaluation of her left, uh, wrist pain that began after a trip and fall while leaving Groundlings. She states that it was painful then and started to improve slightly. She went to urgent care to get an X-rays that showed no fractures. She was diagnosed with a sprain, but then she went to Massachusetts and the humidity increased her pain, and she became concerned. She is here for evaluation and treatment. On exam, left upper extremity skin is clean and intact without erythema or hematemosis. No specific tendon inflammation. Mild tendon inflammation over the ECU tendon. Um, there is pain with pro-supination. No evidence of subluxation of the ECU tendon. Excellent range of motion overall. X-rays are normal through these, the wrist, left wrist. Uh, plan will be, um, we'll call it left ECU tendonitis, left ulnar-sided wrist pain. Uh, you can do RE full. Recommend trial of hand therapy. Recommend MRI for further evaluation. Return to clinic after MRI. And then Terrance Rodski is, um, gonna be an injection only, right middle finger trigger finger injection. And then Amit Jaini, uh, is a left-hand dominant music manager who presents today for the evaluation of his right small finger. Oh, he is status post playing basketball. Date of injury was Saturday, which was, um, 8/2/25. Um, he was referred by Dr. Andrew Weiss. Uh, he presents today for evaluation of his right small finger pain and swelling and deformity that began on 8/2/25. When he injured it playing basketball, he had immediate pain, swelling, limited motion. He saw Dr. Andrew Weiss, who ordered X-rays that demonstrated a fracture. The finger was rotated so he referred him to this office for further evaluation. On exam, right upper extremity skin, moderate ecchymosis to the small finger. There is obvious malrotation of the small finger. There is shortening of the small finger proximal phalanx. Um, limited small finger flexion-extension, able to initiate a thumbs up, et cetera, et cetera. X-rays are three views, demonstrated shortened rotated. Uh, fracture of the small finger proximal phalanx. It'll be planned fracture surgery. Recommend, um, closed reduction percutaneous pinning. We will do this tomorrow. And then David Schechter is a right hand dominant pain medicine doctor, uh, who presents today for evaluation of his right wrist pain, uh, that began around early 2024 in the absence of incident trauma, injury or injection. He states that the, um, pain is intermittent and has not been more consistent or severe of late, but there are certain positions that are consistently painful. He notes pain particularly, uh... Um, it is most reliably painful with supination and flexion. Um... He's here for evaluation and treatment. On exam, this is right upper extremity. Uh, skin is clean, dry and intact without erythema or hematemosis. Some ulnar-sided display mild tendinopathation at the ... uh, ECU tendon. No evidence of ECU subluxation. X-rays are normal. It's four views of the hand with Rolando. Uh, there's mild joint space narrowing at the thumb MCP joint. Um, plan... will be... I don't know, I have to see what Dr. De La George put in. Oh, but for, um, the one we're doing surgery on, the, the young man, Amit Jaini, uh, if you can add under the HPI, if you can add.family history, social history, allergies, meds, that'd be great. And under general, in the physical exam, if you can do.PEHPRG that would be great.",
