            "conversation": "And I'm a pharmacist here at Cedars on South Side. Um, she has bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. She presents today for evaluation of her bilateral hand numbness and tingling as well as burning pain that began around July 1, 2025. She says that she had similar symptoms at the very end of her previous pregnancy, but these are earlier and more intense. Um, she has been seeing her OB, who recommended, um... Injections and referred her to this office. On exam, bilateral upper extremity skin is clean, dry, and intact without erythema or ecchymosis. Um... Got PCTS, uh, some decreased sensation to the middle fingers, noted. X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy, it'll be planned carpal tunnel. Uh, she has already been wearing splints without, uh, enough improvement to be able to sleep through the night. At this point, I recommend trial of injections. We talked about the risks, we talked about the temporary nature, um, she understands. We will do them today. Uh, return to clinic in three months for followup if symptoms persist postpartum.",
