            "conversation": "We'll start with Chaz Thomas who is here today for a follow-up. He took his splint off yesterday because he got somebody else's blood on it. He wants to know what he can do and how things look. On exam, um, laceration, clean dry and intact with sutures. Sutures removed today, patient tolerating well without apparent complication. Excellent, thumbs up but some pain, um, limited flexion. Um, plan, it'll be sutured in today. Recommend transition to removable splint. Uh, recommend initiation of hand therapy. Return to clinic in two weeks for follow-up and range of motion check. And then Meesha Senuda is here today for a follow-up. She says that she's doing okay overall. She has been wearing her splint at night and sometimes during the day. She continues to have some sensitivity and stiffness of the PIP but she feels like it is improving and she is working on it. Um, on exam, significantly limited flexion at the DIP joint. PIP, um, with a sensation of stiffness but able to flex at least to 90 degrees, minimal tenosynovitis distally, some hypersensitivity distally. Um, x-ray is deferred. Um, plan will be, uh, recommend discontinue splint entirely, okay to continue to wear at night. Return to clinic in six weeks for follow-up. Oh, recommend home exercise program for strengthening. Um, she would like to defer therapy for now. I think this is reasonable. And then Grace Twan is here today for MRI review. She saw her results and is happy and sad at the same time. Uh, Dr. Sidlow gave her, uh, IM Kenalog injection to help with the mass as well as, um, other aches and pains that she was having, and, um, it made the mass almost entirely go away. She wants to know what we think. Exam is unchanged. Uh, you can pull in the MRI results. Grace will be... We will talk to Dr. Sidlow about, uh, medical control. It seems that she is having worsening symptoms diffusely. Um, this means systemic. Return to clinic in three months or sooner if she wants excisional biopsy. Um, Charles Shaw... Oh hold on, I think I haven't signed his note from last week. Oh, but it's done. You can just copy that forward. Uh, he's here today for follow-up. He said that he is doing well overall. He has not had much pain. He has been okay with his, uh, bulky dressings. Um, exam... If you can just add, there's mild laceration to the proximal nail folds. Um, co-... Incentive, he can protect it within the asterisks. Uh, recommend continue to protect with soft dressings. Uh, dressing should stay clean and dry. Return to clinic in one week for wound check and dressing change. And then, Josefina Mari- Marcial is here today for follow-up. Her right hand hurt so much after her injection, more than it ever had. She, uh, states that over the last week or so it has finally started to feel better, and now it is 80% improved. She wants to, um, know what else she can do. She's also wondering if she can have, uh, an injection in her left. She states that her left is 50% better than her right. Uh, but she has not tried anything for this. Um, on exam, um, bilateral upper extremity skin clean, dry, intact without erythema or eremosis. Um, moderate tenosynovation at the DRUJ. On, uh, bilateral wrist there is some prominence of the ulna bilaterally. Um, limited motion bilaterally. Um, x-rays, I guess we did new x-rays today. Three views of the left wrist demonstrate significant ulnar prominence and, uh, DRUJ arthritis consistent with her rheumatoid state, and then three views of the right wrist, um, the same. There is significant ulna-lunate arthritis noted. Plan, uh, regarding the right, she is doing much better since the injection. Uh, recommend observation for now. Regarding the left, um, wrist arthritis, uh, review the x-rays and clinical scenarios. She has not tried any conservative treatments there. Recommend trial of night splints and, um, home exercise program. Consider injection if no improvement. Um... And then give me a second, I'll dictate the rest in a minute.",
