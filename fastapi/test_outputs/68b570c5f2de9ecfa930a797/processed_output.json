      "The patient is a 75-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes, as evidenced by a current blood glucose level of 272 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 8.8%, which is significantly above the target of less than 7%. The patient reports consuming a donut daily in the morning, which contributes to elevated blood sugar levels. He acknowledges that he has been struggling with diabetes for many years and admits to not adhering to dietary recommendations. He is aware that his current diet, including high-carbohydrate foods such as bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and sweets, is exacerbating his hyperglycemia. The patient is currently on metformin and has recently started Ozempic, which was increased to 2 mg. He is also taking atorvastatin 40 mg for lipid management. The patient denies symptoms of hypoglycemia but reports that his blood sugar remains uncontrolled despite medication. He is motivated to make changes and is willing to reduce donut consumption. He has a history of a recent heart attack in his brother, which he describes as occurring while driving independently, raising concerns about cardiovascular risk. The patient also reports ear wax buildup, which is causing hearing difficulties, and has been advised to use Debrox drops and undergo wax removal. He is scheduled for a diabetic eye exam due to being overdue for one, with the last exam performed one year ago. The patient is retired and reports walking over a mile three times per week, though he does not specify if this is brisk walking or light activity. He is not currently engaging in structured exercise beyond walking. The patient is aware of the need for lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and increased physical activity, but admits to not consistently following through. He is open to guidance and education but requires ongoing support to improve adherence."
