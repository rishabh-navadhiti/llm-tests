He acknowledges that he has been struggling with diabetes for many years and admits to not adhering to dietary recommendations. He is aware that his current diet, including high-carbohydrate foods such as bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and sweets, is exacerbating his hyperglycemia.

The patient denies symptoms of hypoglycemia but reports that his blood sugar remains uncontrolled despite medication. He is motivated to make changes and is willing to reduce donut consumption. He has a history of a recent heart attack in his brother, which he describes as occurring while driving independently, raising concerns about cardiovascular risk. The patient also reports ear wax buildup, which is causing hearing difficulties, and has been advised to use Debrox drops and undergo wax removal. He is scheduled for a diabetic eye exam due to being overdue for one, with the last exam performed one year ago. The patient is retired and reports walking over a mile three times per week, though he does not specify if this is brisk walking or light activity. He is not currently engaging in structured exercise beyond walking.
