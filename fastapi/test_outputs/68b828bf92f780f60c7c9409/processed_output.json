      "The patient is a 75-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes, as evidenced by a current blood glucose level of 272 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 8.8%, which is significantly above the target of less than 7%. The patient reports consuming a donut daily in the morning, which contributes to elevated blood sugar levels. He acknowledges that he has been struggling with diabetes for many years and admits to not adhering to dietary recommendations. The patient is aware that his current diet, including high-carbohydrate foods such as bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and sweets, is exacerbating his hyperglycemia. He is not consistently engaging in physical activity, despite being retired and having time available. The patient has a history of a recent heart attack in his brother, which he describes as occurring while driving independently, raising concerns about cardiovascular risk. He also reports ear wax buildup, which is causing hearing difficulties. The patient is currently on metformin and has recently started Ozempic, but he has not been following the recommended lifestyle modifications. He is open to reducing donut consumption and inquiring about alternatives such as toast and eggs, but remains inconsistent with exercise. The patient is motivated to improve his health but requires structured guidance and support to adhere to treatment recommendations."
