      "The patient presents with a distal ulceration of the left second toe, which was initially identified during a routine examination. The ulcer has been present for an unknown duration, and imaging revealed underlying infection with compromised circulation in the affected area. The patient was informed of the possibility of a six-week course of intravenous antibiotics, which would require self-administration via a PICC line; however, this approach does not guarantee resolution due to poor perfusion. Given the persistent infection and limited response to conservative management, amputation of the distal phalanx of the left second toe was recommended as the optimal intervention. The patient reports no loss of sensation in the feet, and the ulcer was discovered during a physical exam. The patient is currently managing diabetes with an A1C of 6.8, which is considered well-controlled. The patient is scheduled for a preoperative evaluation to assess cardiac risk prior to surgery. The patient is otherwise stable and has no current symptoms of fever, chills, or systemic illness. The patient is aware of the procedure and agrees with the plan. The patient is also undergoing a vein ablation procedure on June 17th, followed by a post-ablation ultrasound on the same date."
