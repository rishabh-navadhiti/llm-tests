      "Mr. Catalina presents with poorly controlled diabetes, evidenced by a blood glucose level of 272 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 8.8%, which is significantly above the target of less than 7%. He reports consuming foods high in carbohydrates, including donuts and toast, despite being advised to follow a diabetic-friendly diet. He acknowledges that he eats these items regularly, particularly in the morning, and admits to not adhering to dietary recommendations. He is aware that his current eating habits are contributing to his elevated glucose levels. He has been taking metformin and recently started Ozempic (semaglutide) at a dose of 1 mg, which he picked up the same day. He is not currently exercising consistently, although he reports walking over a mile daily and attending weight training three times per week. He is interested in receiving another hip injection for persistent hip pain, which worsens with prolonged sitting and driving. He has a history of a previous bursa injection in December, but the exact location and imaging used are unclear. He also reports recurrent ear wax buildup causing intermittent hearing loss, which has been persistent and affects his hearing. He denies any current symptoms of infection or severe pain in the ears. He is concerned about his long-term health due to uncontrolled diabetes and its complications, including elevated triglycerides (288 mg/dL) and a history of a family member having a recent heart attack. He is motivated to improve his health but struggles with adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications."
