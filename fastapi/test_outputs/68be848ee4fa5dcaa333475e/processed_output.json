His most recent blood glucose reading was 272 mg/dL, and his hemoglobin A1C is 8.8%, significantly above the target of under 7%. He reports consuming a donut daily in the morning, which he acknowledges is not consistent with diabetic dietary guidelines. He admits to eating foods high in carbohydrates and sugars, including bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and sweets, despite being aware of the dietary restrictions. He has been non-adherent to dietary recommendations, stating he only has time for a donut in the morning. He is aware that his current eating habits are contributing to his elevated glucose levels. He has not been consistently exercising, although he reports walking over a mile three times per week. He is concerned about his weight and has been walking for exercise. He has a history of a recent heart attack in his brother, which he describes as occurring while the brother was driving himself to a destination. He also reports ear wax buildup, with difficulty hearing and a sensation of blockage. He denies pain in his joints but acknowledges mild arthritis, which he attributes to aging. He is seeking guidance on managing his diabetes, improving his diet, and addressing his ear wax issue."
