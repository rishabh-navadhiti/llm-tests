### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: Nobody ever told me that . Well , whoever told you is wrong . OK , let me show you . What number do you see here ? What do you say ? 272 . That's very bad . The problem is when I see numbers like this , Mr . Catalina , you're eating things you cannot , you're not supposed to eat . Our body doesn't produce sugar . The sugar comes through the mouth , right ? And it's bread , pasta , rice , potatoes or sweets . So when I see 272 , I know that you're not eating the way you're supposed to . So for me to help you , we need to work together . But when I see that you're not , we're not working together , you're working against me . I guess I got my dad . Well , you're the same I've been fighting this diabetes forever , and I know , and I we gonna put the paper here so I can go over it with you . So I do wanna help you , but I'm not a magician . If I give you a medication and you eat sugars , I have to give you another medication and you eat more sugars , and I have to give you another medication . So what I'm giving to you is trying to fight the sugar that you're eating and that's not how it should be . It should be you work together , you follow the diet and I give you the medication to complement the diet , but unfortunately the only time I have a is in the morning , that's what I I have a donut . One donut . You can you cannot have donuts . You're a diabetic . You can , well , you can have a doughnut , but then you need to get on a treadmill for 1 hour , an hour nonstop . I don't do that . So you see my hands are tied or there's another option . I can give you a shot of insulin that you get after you you eat the donut , so you have to give yourself a shot of insulin every day . I mean , I'm offering you an option . I guess I , I guess I can cut the doughnuts down . So So can I have toast then , right ? Again , toasts are carbs . What are you prepared to do physically to get rid of those calories after you eat the toast ? You're retired , right ? So you have time to exercise . I do . What do you mean ? No , it has to be 5 times by the American Diabetes Association . Oh my goodness . Well , I do , I do , uh . My weight , my weight . Seen upstairs 3 times a week and I go off 3 times . Do you walk or do you get in the car to go ? I still walk over a mile . No , but you do the whole green walking , right ? OK , so sugar 272 , hemoglobin A1C 8.8 , pretty bad , it should be under 7 . When I look at your last A1C previous to this one , of course , your A1C is 6.9 , so it means this is the living proof that you're eating things you're not supposed to eat , OK ? When the sugars are high , the triglycerides are gonna be high . They are 288 . They should be under 150 . Now your bad cholesterol is 59 , that is good . We wanna keep it under 100 , so that part is good . And the reason why the bad cholesterol is good is because you're taking atorvastatin 40 . So , what are we gonna do today ? Uh , and I also I want you to know that the uric acid is good , OK , so that part is good . So what are we gonna do today ? We're going to increase the dose of a Zampi to 2 mg . You will continue taking metformin . My advice is please eat the to . OK , got it . Or if you eat the doughnut then immediately you jump on a treadmill and you walk for an hour . But if you eat the donuts then you're gonna , you're gonna get on the treadmill for 2 hours . So that's the rule , one hour per suite . Of of walking on a treadmill . But you're retired , you have the time . I'm retired , so you have the time to do it . So so is is uh is a matter of what you wanna do yourself . I can tell you what I can do as your doctor , which is giving you the medication . I can give you advice , but I don't have any control over the choices you make when you eat instead of the donut , get 2 eggs , add vegetables , add some protein , get some avocado . You can eat it , that is a healthy breakfast for a diabetic , but not at all . I can have eggs though , eggs are fine , of course . Eggs are , are , are OK . Oatmeal , oatmeal is fine , yeah , absolutely . Just don't add any sugar to it . Yeah , whatever it is . OK . Now , the system is telling me that you're due for your eye exam . When was your last eye exam ? OK . We're gonna refer you to Lawless . He's a diabetic eye exam , OK ? Diabetics need to have just , I thought I just went to my , my doctor over there . Who's your doctor ? Uh , I don't have any . He's out outside this hospital , so I don't get any . I don't get any reports . So when was that ? as I said , he doesn't send me anything , so I cannot see that . Yeah , he does that diabetic thing with him , but has it been less than a year ? Probably a year . OK , can you call and make an appointment , please ? OK , thank you . All right . So I'm gonna listen to your lungs and your heart . I am going to increase the dose of a Zamic then to 2 mg instead of 1 just serve and then we're gonna recheck your A1C again in 3 months , OK ? Mo And I'm honest with you , with the amount of Ozempic that you're taking , you should be able to control your sugars . I mean , you're taking a pretty good dose . Yeah , I just ordered that , so what happens now ? So did you that one . I , I picked it up today . So you did already ? Yeah , OK , so use what you have , OK , 4 doses . Yeah , use those 4 doses and then pick up the new one and then we're gonna see you not in 3 months , but in 4 months , OK ? Do they have some from triglycerides ? Uh , yes , there's something called diet . Mhm Deep breath in and out . OK . I So . And then listen to your heart . So , You know what to do . Or you know what to do , and as I said , I can show you the way , but you decide if you want that way or not . So , I'll see you in 4 months . It gave out these things in my hand . OK . OK , this is called arthritis , it is arthritis , yeah , we get this . Yeah on over here . Is they wear and tear . We're not getting any younger . Yeah , those things are caused by arthritis arthritis that we start getting when we , I mean , I myself , I'm gonna turn 61 . I'm getting arthritis a little bit . I'm 75 , so , so that's arthritis , you see how firm they are . Yeah , and I , and I wish that I , that there is , there is a cure for that . Let me show you something , but I don't have to be worried about . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . What about this ear that keeps give me just a second . I wanna show you something , OK ? Yeah , that's it . Yeah . As evidence notes that we all get with arthritis , unfortunately . You see , clinical manifestations of arthritis . That's what we get in the hints . Yeah , I wish , uh , I wish it was something I would use it myself . Yeah , they didn't hurt . I mean , yeah , but that that appears with a non rheumatoid arthritis is the normal wear and tear . And what's going on with the ear ? you were saying you see here keeps plugging up comes up and goes away . Take a look . I'll take a look . How's the tavern ? Well , my brother's running , I guess he's doing all right . He just had a heart attack . Oh , I'm so sorry . Did he recover ? Yeah , he's . Sorry , well , he lives out there and then just before you get to . He lives just before you get into polo . Ah , polo . OK . He had a heart attack and he drove all the way to KST by himself . That is not a good idea . I do OK , I understand . Why can you but you have this block is covered with wax . It's like a wall . No wonder you can hear anything . Yeah , so this is what we need to do . You're going to buy something called Trox . I'm gonna write the name the name down . You're gonna put some drops there . Then I'm gonna bring you back here . We're gonna take that wax out , OK ? Yeah , your ears are full of wax . I say I can close up . I perfectly understand . So I'm gonna write the name here , you see .

And so , and we talked , I know you had the injection in December . That was in the left hip , I think , correct ? OK . Was that in the hip itself or was that on the side ? So maybe it was a bursa injection . It was through , he was an ultrasound ? Yeah , but that could be either . I , I don't know . So what's happening with you now ? So it , it's somewhat dependent on the day , right ? The days where I can move more consistently throughout the day . It's less painful for days that , you know , you have to drive and sit and all that kind of stuff . By the end of the day , it's pretty painful . I would like to get another injection . I've been trying to schedule with my other doctor in this I can but I schedule for a second . So if I could get uh sooner from your heart . Yeah , so the question is , I guess there's , there's really two flavors of hip injections . There's um the one on the side which we do for the bursa . And then there's the one we do in the hip joint really for arthritis . Now , we know you have some arthritis in there , and I guess , where's your pain ? Yeah , at this point , location wise , right , so it's here . It's on the side . Yeah , yeah , come , come on up here . Let me , let me poke around here a little bit .
