### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: Fan , how are you ? Hey , good morning , doctor . I'm fine . How are you ? Thank you . We have a pretty busy today . Let's get started . This one to me is . Morning . How you doing ? So Jenny to get rid of that , uh , the , the tip or the whole thing , just the tip , OK .
Patient: just the distal failing , so there was uh an ulcer , there's an ulcer . So and they looked at the X-ray and it looks like the infection has
Doctor_1: that ,
Patient: . So did they say to you the possibility would have been IV antibiotics for 6 weeks that you would have to do yourself versus which does not guarantee that the infection is gonna get , gonna be taken care of because of a circulation is , is limited in that area . So that's why you guys decided that the best thing to do is . Yeah , I don't know why they didn't tell you about the aspirin . Yeah , we want , we don't want surgeons don't want patients on aspirin . They should have told you that . So I
Doctor_1: Dr . Swanson , the same . Hey Kyle , good morning .
Patient: , I'm doing well , yourself ? Hey , I see you , Mr . Harshman today . You see her next to me . Um , question , he , he took an aspirin today . He said nobody told him to stop the aspirin . Are you OK with that for the surgery

But Just wanted to confirm because I don't want you to get there and then tell you uh uh go home . So , I'm sorry that this happened , but it's the best course of action because they would have to put up what is called a PICC line and you would have to give yourself the , the antibiotic and , and the truth is I have seen many times that patients go through 6 weeks of antibiotics and still the infection doesn't get .
Doctor_1: , it doesn't go away .
Patient: . Do you , do you have sensation in your feet ?
Doctor_1: . All right . So it's . Um , callous , callous all up there .
Patient: you saw the ulcer , you found it yourself , OK , because you know what happened . The reason why I'm asking is because sometimes patients with diabetes , once they lose the sensation , they don't know there is an ulcer . I'm pretty good . And , and not many , not many people do this to look at the bottom of the bone . So yours is , is in the bottom , the bottom , right ?
Doctor_1:

Yeah , the last time that we looked at your A1C , your A1C was 6.8 , so I'm happy with that , OK ? All right . So when it comes to
Doctor_1: surgery .
Patient: reason for why they want me to see you is because they want to make sure that there's no cardiac risk , OK , for
Doctor_1: surgery .
Patient: there's an algorithm that we follow . Is this a high-risk surgery ? No . You have a history of heart attacks , stands , open heart surgery ? No . Do you have a history of congestion or failure ? No . You have a history of a stroke ? No . Would you be a patient who would require insulin ? No , I mean , during the surgery . Are you a patient whose kidneys are failing ? No . So it means that the risk is not . Or no , I mean , we cannot say 0 . So it's low , medium , or high .
Doctor_1: you , are you gonna be taking time off ? I'm already on
Spk_2: 
Doctor_1: week weekend and very bloody and stuff . Relax . OK , OK . Deep breath in now . OK . OK .

Patient: your decision . As your doctor , I always tell patients to ride motorcycle
Doctor_1: work . Yeah . So lungs are clear , heart sounds fine , the vitals are good . No fever
