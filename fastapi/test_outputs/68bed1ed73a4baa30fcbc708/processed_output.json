      "The patient presents with a distal ulceration on the left second toe, which was initially identified during a routine examination. The ulcer has been present for an unknown duration, and imaging revealed underlying infection with compromised circulation in the affected area. The patient was informed of the possibility of a six-week course of intravenous antibiotics, which would require self-administration via a PICC line; however, this approach does not guarantee resolution due to poor perfusion. Given the persistent infection and limited response to conservative management, surgical intervention was deemed the most appropriate course. The patient reports no prior awareness of the need to discontinue aspirin prior to surgery, though he took aspirin on the day of the visit. The patient denies any loss of sensation in the feet, and the ulcer is located on the plantar surface of the distal phalanx of the left second toe. The patient is currently managing diabetes with an A1C of 6.8, which is considered well-controlled. He is otherwise asymptomatic and denies fever, chills, or systemic symptoms. The patient is scheduled for amputation of the distal phalanx of the left second toe, and the procedure is deemed medically safe given the absence of significant cardiac or renal comorbidities."
