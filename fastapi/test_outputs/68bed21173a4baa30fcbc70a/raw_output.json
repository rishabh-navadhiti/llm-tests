His most recent blood glucose reading was 272 mg/dL, and his hemoglobin A1C is 8.8%, significantly above the target of under 7%. He reports consuming a donut daily in the morning, which he acknowledges is not consistent with diabetic dietary guidelines. He admits to eating foods high in carbohydrates and sugars, including bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and sweets, despite being aware of the dietary restrictions. He has not been adhering to a recommended diabetic diet and has not engaged in sufficient physical activity to offset caloric intake. He is aware that his current habits are contributing to elevated glucose and triglyceride levels, which are 288 mg/dL (normal <150 mg/dL). He has been taking metformin and atorvastatin 40 mg, and recently started Ozempic, which he picked up today. He is currently on 1 mg of Ozempic and will be increased to 2 mg. He is motivated to improve his diet and has expressed willingness to reduce donut consumption. He has not exercised regularly, though he walks over a mile three times per week. He is concerned about his health, particularly regarding his recent weight loss and hearing issues. He reports that his ears are full of wax, which is affecting his hearing. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease, as his brother recently suffered a heart attack and drove himself to the hospital, which the provider deemed unsafe. He is scheduled for a diabetic eye exam, which he last had one year ago. He is currently not on any other medications beyond those previously mentioned. He is not currently experiencing acute symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or neurological deficits.
