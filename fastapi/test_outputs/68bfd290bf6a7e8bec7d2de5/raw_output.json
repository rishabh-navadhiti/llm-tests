The patient reports consuming high-carbohydrate foods, including daily donuts, despite being advised to follow a diabetic-friendly diet. He acknowledges that he has been struggling with diabetes for many years and admits to not adhering to dietary recommendations. He states he only has time for a donut in the morning, which he consumes regularly. The patient is aware that his current eating habits contribute to his elevated glucose levels but expresses difficulty in making lifestyle changes. He is currently retired and reports walking over a mile three times per week, though he uses a car for some travel. He denies pain in his joints but notes stiffness consistent with arthritis. He also reports having a history of high triglycerides (288 mg/dL), which are above the normal range of under 150 mg/dL. The patient has not had a diabetic eye exam in the past year and is referred for a follow-up with an ophthalmologist. He is also noted to have impacted cerumen in both ears, which is causing hearing difficulties. The patient is currently on metformin and has recently started Ozempic, which was increased to 2 mg. He is advised to continue medication and modify diet, with the option of using insulin after meals if he consumes high-carbohydrate foods. He is instructed to walk on a treadmill for one hour per donut consumed. The patient is motivated to reduce donut intake and inquires about acceptable alternatives such as toast and eggs, which are approved with modifications. He is advised to eat eggs, vegetables, avocado, and unsweetened oatmeal as healthier breakfast options. The patient is also advised to use ear drops (Debrox) and schedule a follow-up appointment for cerumen removal. He is scheduled for a follow-up visit in 4 months to recheck HbA1c.\"\n    ],\n    \"default\": \"-\",\n    \"instruction\": \"Provide a detailed summary of the patient's current illness based on their report.
