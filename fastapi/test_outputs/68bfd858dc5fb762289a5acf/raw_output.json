The patient reports consuming a donut daily in the morning, which contributes to elevated blood sugar levels. He acknowledges that he has been struggling with diabetes for many years and admits to not adhering to dietary recommendations. He is aware that his current eating habits, particularly the intake of high-carbohydrate foods such as donuts and toast, are exacerbating his hyperglycemia. The patient is retired and has time to exercise but currently only walks approximately one mile three times per week. He is not engaging in the recommended five weekly exercise sessions as advised by the American Diabetes Association. The patient is also noted to have elevated triglycerides at 288 mg/dL, which are above the normal threshold of 150 mg/dL. He denies any symptoms related to his diabetes, such as fatigue, polyuria, or polydipsia. The patient is aware of the need for an annual diabetic eye exam, which he last had one year ago, and has been referred to a specialist for this purpose. He is currently on metformin and has recently started Ozempic, which was increased to 2 mg. He is also taking atorvastatin 40 mg, which has helped maintain his LDL cholesterol at a favorable level of 59 mg/dL. The patient is concerned about ear wax buildup, which he reports as causing hearing difficulty, and has been advised to use Debrox drops and undergo wax removal. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease, including a brother who recently suffered a heart attack and drove himself to the hospital, which the physician deemed unsafe.
