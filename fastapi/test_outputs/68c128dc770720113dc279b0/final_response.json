The pain recurs with walking exceeding 15-20 minutes and is exacerbated by stair climbing and prolonged sitting. The patient describes stiffness after sitting for extended periods and mild evening swelling without redness. Pain severity is rated at 6/10 during ambulation, decreasing with rest. There is no history of knee locking or trauma in the past two weeks. Five years ago, the patient sustained a twisting injury to the right knee during a cricket match, which resolved with rest. The patient has not undergone surgery on the knee. The symptoms have impacted daily activities, particularly walking and stair climbing. The patient is currently following instructions to avoid long walks and stair climbing, apply hot fomentation twice daily for 10-15 minutes, and take prescribed pain relief medication. The provider plans to reassess in 2 weeks; if symptoms improve, physiotherapy may be initiated. Immediate follow-up is advised if pain worsens or knee locking occurs."
