She developed worsening pain in the right knee due to overcompensation, which she delayed addressing during the pandemic. Both knees are currently symptomatic, with the patient describing shin splint-like pain in both legs. The right knee is swollen, with limited range of motion and inability to fully extend the leg. She reports difficulty bearing weight and required assistance getting in and out of a sand chair and kitchen during a recent three-week trip to New England involving extensive walking on sand. She developed new-onset sciatica in the left buttock one week after returning from Massachusetts, which she attributes to prolonged sitting during a flight. The sciatica and knee pain have not improved. She notes distended veins and a sensation of pressure behind the right knee, described as a rubber band pulling, which may indicate a Bakerâ€™s cyst. She has been using ice and topical gel for relief but cannot use NSAIDs due to stage 2-3 kidney disease. She fell on August 23rd in Maine, injuring her left hip and knee, though no bruising was observed. She has a history of thyroidectomy due to nodules, and is currently managing kidney disease with Farsega and Ozemic. She is a former nurse, currently unemployed after being laid off from Health Net, and is seeking knee replacement to return to work. She has undergone physical therapy and developed tendinitis in the left foot as a result. She has not had an MRI, and the doctor does not believe it would change management. She expresses a desire to proceed with knee replacement, favoring the left knee as the initial procedure due to it being the original site of symptoms and being more severely affected on X-ray.\"\n    ],\n    \"default\": \"-\",\n    \"instruction\": \"Provide a detailed summary of the patient's current illness based on their report.
