        "The patient reports chronic bilateral knee pain, with the left knee initially being the primary issue and now the right knee more symptomatic. She had an arthroscopy in 2018 that provided temporary relief, but overcompensation led to worsening of the right knee. She delayed orthopedic intervention during the pandemic. She recently returned from a three-week trip to New England involving extensive walking on sand, which exacerbated her symptoms. She experienced difficulty bearing weight, required assistance to rise from a sand chair and move in and out of the kitchen, and developed new-onset sciatica in the left buttock, likely due to prolonged sitting during a flight. The right knee is swollen, with limited extension and a sensation of tightness behind the knee described as a rubber band pulling, suggestive of a Bakerâ€™s cyst. She has been using ice and topical gel, but cannot use NSAIDs due to stage 2-3 kidney disease. She has a history of a fall on August 23rd in Maine, injuring her left hip and knee, though no bruising was noted. She has chronic foot issues with tendinitis from physical therapy, managed by a podiatrist. She is a nurse with stage 2-3 kidney disease, GFR 32 at its lowest, now stabilized at 42 on Farsen and Ozemic. She is on baby aspirin, has a history of thyroidectomy due to nodules, and is currently unemployed, seeking to return to work. She expresses a strong desire to proceed with knee replacement, favoring the left knee as the initial procedure due to its chronicity and prior history, despite the right knee appearing more acute. She is not currently considering an MRI, as it is unlikely to change management."
