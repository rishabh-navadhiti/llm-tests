        "The patient reports bilateral knee pain that has progressively worsened over time, with the left knee being the initial site of symptoms. She had an arthroscopy in 2018, which provided temporary relief by removing debris, but she subsequently overcompensated, leading to worsening of the right knee. She delayed orthopedic intervention during the pandemic. Currently, both knees are painful, with the right knee being particularly symptomatic. She describes pain with weight-bearing, limited range of motion, and swelling in the right knee, which prevented her from fully extending the leg. She notes distended veins and a sensation of pressure behind the right knee, described as a rubber band-like pull, suggestive of a Baker’s cyst. She reports new-onset sciatica in the left buttock, which began one week after returning from a three-week trip to New England involving extensive walking on sand and boat travel. She required assistance from two people to rise from a sand chair and to move in and out of the kitchen. She has been using ice and topical gel (Var) for symptom relief but cannot use NSAIDs due to stage 2–3 chronic kidney disease. The sciatica and knee pain have not improved. She fell on August 23rd in Maine, injuring her left hip and knee, though there was no bruising. She has a history of tendinitis in the left foot from physical therapy, managed by a podiatrist. She expresses strong desire to proceed with knee replacement surgery, particularly to regain independence and return to work. She is currently unemployed and seeking to undergo surgery before resuming employment. She is considering the left knee for initial replacement due to its chronicity and worse radiographic findings, though the right knee is more acutely symptomatic. She is not currently requesting an MRI, as she believes it would not change management. She is open to proceeding with surgery and has expressed willingness to move forward."
