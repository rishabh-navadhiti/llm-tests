### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: So we put on the schedule and put an order in , to use the system . Is it in right now ? No , you did it yesterday . Oh is it ? And with my mother-in-law . Yeah , yeah . Wendy , uh , order for the X-ray right now . I can , we can do it . I don't think we put it in yet , but should we ? And then will that work out to move this to do that ? How would we do that ? It should transfer Um , or else it just stays in here , but it stays in here with no name . I just left it as an urgent . But you can , you , can you put , you can you assign , if we put the order , can you assign that X-ray to that order ? Yeah , so we should put the order . If you want it on there , yeah , we're gonna , I'm gonna make a document because you got , it's like insurance might be involved , so I can make a note . So we can do that . We're gonna do that . We're gonna do it . I'm walking away . Oh , here we go . Now he's pretty . Like Uh , OK . Well , if not , we'll figure out a way to deal with it . Uh , I'll put it . It was , what was it , uh , you put it in , Chris , your forearm to you , to the forearm . I know right forearm . And then , uh , yeah , perfect . That's from yesterday . See Michelle Fico .
Patient: ,
Doctor_1: are
Patient: ?
Doctor_1: Doctor last year . Have we met before or no ? Nice to meet you . All right . So tell me about the knees here .
Patient: in before the pandemic , um , I was being seen by Doctor Mark Joe at , um , I was , and we talked about a knee replacement for this leg . I had an arthroscopy done , um . Uh , 2018 or something like that . Uh , not by Doctor Joe , but by one of his associates who left the practice . Um , anyway , um , and the arthroscopy helped this knee . They removed the debris that was floating around and , uh , it's so , but if you need to lock , it just was less painful unlocking it . And uh , But I overcompensated and the right knee got worse . And um but I put off anything orthopedically during the pandemic . I just thought was . So anyway , um , both knees bother me . I get shin splints , uh , that's what I call them because that's what they feel like , uh , in both legs . And , um , um , this leg doesn't , the right knee doesn't block , but it's very painful . And I just got back from 3 weeks in , in New England . Visiting family and friends that I was in and on boats . I was a lot of walking on the beach and the sand . It required two people to help me to get up from a sand chair and two people to help me get in and out of the kitchen . I can't live that way . And I'm 72 and I regret not having the knee replacement in the knees . the worst one , would you say ? Well , it's tough to say . awful . I returned from Massachusetts uh a week ago today . And ever since I've been back , I've had sciatica . And uh well , for that ? Well , this is new . This is a new symptom . I think it was from the plane ride . I was so tense sitting in the seat and I wasn't able to get up because my seat mate , but the aisle was disabled , so I didn't want to bother . So I was sitting there so tense and my knees are bothering me and my back . So anyway , I came home with um really bad sciatica on my left buttock . And then I also , um , this knee seems so swollen . I couldn't even put it flat on the bed . I couldn't extend it . It , I can't now . It's much better . I , I've been icing it , um , been putting Var on it , the gel . Yes , I can't take NSAIDs because I have some kidney disease . I stay away from NSAIDs , um . So , uh , and I could barely bear weight on this right knee . Um ,
Doctor_1: it swollen ?
Patient: thought it was swollen . Yes , I was worried that there might be fluid in there . Um , one particular day when I got into the boat , it was just jarring motion on my right knee , just jarring . It's a pain at my , my legs . So , um , but , um , like I said , it's better . Yeah , uh , the range of motion is better , but , um , And I can bear weight now when I could before . Now I can extend the leg . It is , it hasn't improved . The sciatica hasn't improved the back is really still tight so .
Doctor_1: , let me see you straight out this left one . Good . Bend it back all the way . Yeah , yeah , your motion's pretty good . Let's do this one straight out . Bend it back . It seems like the right one is worse at least today , yeah ? Yeah , move the , move the hips back and forth . Good . This side now , back and forth , good . When you have pain in the knees , is the whole thing , is it localized ?
Patient: , it's really the whole thing , plus with this knee , um , I noticed that my veins are kind of distended , plus I felt pressure in behind my knee . Like something was pulling , uh , like a rubber band or something , which was making my range of motion worse . That might have been ,
Doctor_1: might have had a little baker cyst back there . Sometimes people will describe it exactly like you did like a rubber band that the ceiling . I mean , X-ray wise , you have some arthritis in there . It's not the worst case I've ever seen . I mean , it's , I would call this modern arthritis . So right knee , left knee , let me pull that up a little bit . So we're looking at the space here . That's not a space , that's your cartilage , right ? That's your cushion . What we don't wanna see is no space , right ? And so you still have a space here . Is it an 18 year old's knee ? No . OK . So this , you got a little wear and tear , little bone spurs here . So it's not nothing . And then if we look at your kneecaps here , you know , more wear and tear underneath the kneecaps here , you can see . This is your kneecap here , bone spur , bone spur . And that will give you pain if you uh squat , lunge , stairs , that kind of thing , like getting up from the chair , like you said , that's probably making that difficult . Same thing , actually , a little worse on the left , which was kind of where this all started . But you see bone spurs here and here . So , I mean , look , this is , this is what it is , we know what it is . The big question always is , what do we do about it ? And the answer is , well , you can't take NSAIDs . All right , so that's out . Physical therapy ? Yeah , sure . Why not ? That's never the wrong answer . We can certainly talk about that . There are injectables , right ? Maybe you've had these like cortisone , etc . Have you've been through all that ?
Patient: , I had course and I also had the
Doctor_1: , what do you think of the gel ? Nothing . Yeah , it's a 50/50 deal . So if , if you're in the bath 50% , that's kind of what people say . And then the final straw is knee replacement . So you get the , you , that's the , that's the menu , that's the menu of options . So I mean , it really kind of depends on you and what direction you wanna take this and . But because you've been dealing with this a long time and I ,
Patient: know , I don't want to have to have two people helping me up and down . I mean , that's , and I live in a two-star condo , so I'm up and down . Yes ,
Doctor_1: we're talking about knee replacement , then we'd have to decide which one would be first . It's cause they're kind of taking turns on you here a little bit . I mean , X-ray wise , the left one's a hair worse . But I mean , that was the , and that was the original one that kind of gave you trouble , but the , it's , that's really your choice . So what , what's involved , knee replacement , two-hour operation . By default is you spend a night in the hospital . If you're a go-getter , can you go home the same day ? Yeah , but , you know , if you're not , if you're not gonna push it , we'll keep you overnight , let you go home the next day . When you go home , therapy comes to the house and they'll come and see you a couple of times a week for the first month . I check you back in 2 weeks at that point , uh , you don't like me , and then you kind of like me at 6 weeks that you like me . So the hard part , is not the walking . You'll do that very quickly . What people don't like is the bending cause guess what ? That's the part that hurts . But that's the critical part of class of therapy afterwards . How's your health ?
Patient: , um , I should mention to you , I fell on August 23rd in Maine . You know , all devices have steps to go up . And I missed the stuff and I fell on my left hip on my left knee . And uh this hip that has been sore , you know . But I didn't see any bruising . I just , it was just sort of , so , um , anyway , um . Heart's
Doctor_1: , lungs OK , kidneys OK , no
Patient: . I , you know , I'm a nurse ,
Doctor_1: ? I did that . Yeah . That sucks .
Patient: . So , um , Stage 2 to 3 kidney disease . My um GFR was all the way down to 32 , and I panicked , but we got it back up to 42 . I'm on uh Farsega and Ozemic which has helped her kidney uh disease as . Oh yeah , so grateful cause I was panicking thinking I too . Um . I had , I had gotten down from like 195 to 173 , but I think I've gained a few pounds back . So , but um , yeah , so I don't know it's not big and fortiga . Uh , I don't know of any cardiac problems . Um , I'm not aware of any . Are you taking any blood thinners ? I just take baby aspirin . Yeah . And uh what else ? I think that's it . I , I'm , um . Oh , I had a thyroidectomy because I had numerous nodules in my thyroid , and they couldn't decide whether it was benign or malignant . So I said take this take out . I didn't want that . That was um a year and a half ago . Uh , and , uh , Simon said it and um . Um , What else , um , you should probably know , I have abundance on my feet , so I just wanted to see what kind of condition my feet are . That's fine . That this is a chronic condition . I did physical therapy , um , because my PCP made me basically , uh , well , so I could have a consult , an ortho consult but I was begging for an ortho consult and it's .
Doctor_1: is Dudley or ,
Patient: . Because of my insurance , so I had physical therapy , a functional physical therapist .
Doctor_1: you've been through already . Yeah , good .
Patient: . But I ended up with um tendinitis on my left foot because they made me do these toes things . And so I'm seeing a podiatrist for that . So , um , she was gonna inject uh er into the tendon , and I just haven't had done yet . So causelu wanted me wear a boot afterwards and I was like ,
Doctor_1: . All right . So you got a few irons in the fire . Yeah , I mean , as far as this , the knee replacement , it's really kind of your call . I'm booking a few months ahead just so we keep that in mind . So , if then when you say , hey , I wanna do it , then we can get the ball rolling and then you , you just need to pick a side .
Patient: . All right . Yeah , I'm , I'm not employed right now . I was laid off from my job at Health Net , uh , services , uh , December 31st , and , um , I didn't plan to retire , so I'm still looking for a job but , um , and , uh , so I would like to go back to work , but I'm thinking I'd like to get the knees done before I think about returning to work .
Doctor_1: 
Patient: saying I could have one knee done probably before the end . Oh .
Doctor_1: , but we need to get the ball rolling now .
Patient: you think I shouldn't put it off ?
Doctor_1: think that's up to you . I think this is really dependent on you and your symptoms . So , like I said , I mean , you were sort of dealing with this even 5 years ago . So I mean , I , you know , you kind of know what to expect . It's , what , what to expect is kind of what you've been going through already . So you say , well , I don't like that , then , then that's a reason to fix it . If you say , well , I can tolerate and I'm not ready , that's , then fine . That's really your fault .
Patient: . And , uh , you know , not gonna recommend an MRI on my knees at this point ? I don't think it's gonna change anything . Um , Well , I don't know which , which insurance . I'm not sure . I think I would go ,
Doctor_1: can think about it . I don't mean to put you under the gun . Are you on the portal ?
Patient: .
Doctor_1: Cedar sin portal . If you're on it , you can just message us . Like you think about it , talk about it with your family , and then , you know , let me know . And as soon as you say , hey , let's do it , we can put the order in and then the ball will get rolling . OK . Cause we do need to pick a side of your knee replacement . We just say , yeah , they want more special than that .
Patient: . Well , this one seems more acute . This is chronic . So I don't , but it's also a little more stable . Well ,
Doctor_1: I
Patient: ,
Doctor_1: don't , this is not a question we have to answer at this moment . So , yeah , let me know and then we'll get the ball rolling . We'll get you fixed up .
Patient: you don't think there's any fluid accumulation ? There is a little bit , but just a little bit , not too . Would you remove the Baker cyst when you go ahead and do the decompresses
Doctor_1: part of the usually does ,
Patient: . And the shin splints are from the ,
Doctor_1: might be from the knee actually . So occasionally people will get deferred pain right down in there from the arthritis . All right . You let us know .
Patient: , yes , I , well , I mean , I can let you know today . I , I , I want to proceed . I mean , that's why , yeah , I'm going to proceed . We don't , I can't get this up . We just needed
Doctor_1: silent side .
Patient: , Can you pick ?
Doctor_1: , I would say we do the left one first . That's , that's the original problem , Mary , cause the acute thing that's gonna get , if we do nothing , that acute pain cause you've been on a trip is probably gonna get better . But the left one's been the one . So if you leave it to me , I'd take the 1 . It's a little worse than the X-ray
