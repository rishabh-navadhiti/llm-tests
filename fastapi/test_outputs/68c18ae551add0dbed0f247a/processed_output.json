      "The patient has severe degenerative scoliosis with significant spinal curvature, leading to nerve impingement at L1-S1. There is mild spinal stenosis at L3-L4 and severe disc disease from L1 to S1. The cervical spine is stable with no stenosis. The patient also has a valgus deformity of the left knee, contributing to gait instability and pain. The patient is experiencing chronic back pain with functional limitations, requiring a walker for ambulation. The patient is not a candidate for immediate surgery due to concerns about bone strength and comorbidities. The primary diagnosis is degenerative scoliosis with secondary knee pathology. Differential diagnoses include lumbar spinal stenosis, degenerative joint disease of the knee, and postural imbalance due to structural deformity. Pertinent positive findings include spinal curvature, pain with sitting and ambulation, use of a walker, and MRI findings of disc disease and mild stenosis. Negative findings include no neurological deficits in upper extremities, no signs of infection or systemic illness. The condition is stable but progressive, with worsening pain and mobility limitations. Comorbidities include osteoarthritis of the knee and ankle, and a history of laparoscopic surgery. The patient is motivated to pursue treatment but is hesitant about surgery."
