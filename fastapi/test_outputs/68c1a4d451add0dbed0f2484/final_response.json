The patient reports minimal relief (20%) from a prior C4-C7 injection, suggesting that the pain source may be more proximal, likely originating from C3-C4 and C4-C5 levels, which are noted to be dynamically spondylotic. The physical exam reveals bilateral neck tenderness and spasms at the base of the skull, with normal short exams. The lack of significant neurological deficits supports a primarily musculoskeletal or facet joint origin, though radicular symptoms remain a consideration. Comorbidities include chronic neck pain with a history of prior NBC (likely a cervical spine procedure)."
