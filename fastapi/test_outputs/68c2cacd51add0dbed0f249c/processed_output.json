      "A 41-year-old right-hand dominant female dentist and root canal specialist reported the onset of left elbow pain in May 2025, which began after moving heavy objects. The pain is described as throbbing, particularly at night, and is exacerbated by flexing the elbow. The patient notes that the pain has been gradually improving. She reports a history of accidentally striking the lateral aspect of the elbow against a door jam, which caused a brief sensation of bruising. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the lateral epicondyle, pain with resisted wrist extension, and normal elbow range of motion (5/140). Radiographic imaging of the left elbow demonstrated no acute fracture, dislocation, or degenerative changes. The patient is currently under evaluation for lateral epicondylitis. She is accompanied by her mother during the visit, who provided support and expressed gratitude for the care received. The patient has not experienced any worsening of symptoms since the initial onset."
