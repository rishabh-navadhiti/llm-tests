She reports nocturnal pain and has been evaluated at urgent care on May 25, 2024, where X-rays revealed arthritis and a brace was prescribed, though she dislikes wearing it. She also experiences left thumb pain, particularly when holding her phone, which she believes is a contributing factor. She has a history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, status post right endoscopic carpal tunnel release on November 5, 2020. The left side has now recurred. She was previously evaluated for rheumatoid arthritis but was told she does not have it. Physical examination reveals mild to diffuse soft tissue swelling, minimal tenderness at the left thumb CMC joint, mild thenar atrophy, and mild weakness in the left thenar eminence, which appears stable compared to prior findings. Nerve conduction studies from September 16, 2020, showed very severe right carpal tunnel syndrome and moderate left carpal tunnel syndrome. X-rays of the left hand demonstrate mild to moderate degenerative changes at multiple interphalangeal joints and moderate degenerative changes at the left thumb CMC joint. The patient is seeking evaluation and treatment for her left hand symptoms."
