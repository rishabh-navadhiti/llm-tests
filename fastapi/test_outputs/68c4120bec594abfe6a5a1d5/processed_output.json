      "The patient is a 75-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes, as evidenced by a current blood glucose level of 272 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 8.8%, which is significantly above the target of less than 7%. The patient reports consuming a donut daily in the morning, which contributes to elevated blood sugar levels. He acknowledges that he has been struggling with diabetes for many years and admits to not adhering to dietary recommendations. The patient is aware that his current diet, particularly high in carbohydrates and sugars, is exacerbating his condition. He has not been consistently following a diabetic-friendly diet, despite being advised to do so. The patient is currently on metformin and has recently started Ozempic, which was increased to 2 mg. He is also taking atorvastatin 40 mg for lipid management. The patient has not been exercising regularly, although he reports walking over a mile three times per week. He denies pain or discomfort related to his joints but acknowledges mild arthritis. He has a history of a recent heart attack in his brother, who recovered but drove himself to the hospital after the event. The patient also reports ear wax buildup, which is affecting hearing, and has been advised to use Debrox drops and undergo wax removal. The patient is motivated to improve his health and is willing to reduce donut consumption and modify his diet, including considering eggs, vegetables, avocado, and oatmeal without added sugar. He is scheduled for a diabetic eye exam and will be referred to Dr. Lawless for evaluation."
