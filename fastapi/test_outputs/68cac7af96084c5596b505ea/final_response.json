        "The patient presents with progressive right leg weakness and anterior thigh pain, attributed to right L3-4 spinal stenosis. Symptoms began in late June 2023, with onset of pain and weakness noted around the 30th of June. The patient reports 16 falls since symptom onset, including a recent fall down the stairs. The patient has difficulty straightening the right leg, with a strength of 2/5 in the right quadriceps. Despite prior interventions, including a corticosteroid injection for suspected tendon inflammation, symptoms have not improved. The patient is unable to drive due to lack of control and requires bracing for ambulation. She relies on her husband for mobility assistance, though he is unable to walk with her. The patient has a history of breast cancer diagnosed in 2010, with recurrence in 2018 involving bone metastasis. She has been under oncologic follow-up and is currently undergoing surveillance with imaging, including a PET scan scheduled for August 24, 2023, to assess for disease progression. The patient was previously evaluated by a neurosurgeon who recommended a vertebroplasty, but this was deferred due to concurrent radiation therapy plans. The patient expresses concern about the progression of her condition and the impact on her independence and safety."
