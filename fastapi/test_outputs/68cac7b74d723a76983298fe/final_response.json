        "The patient reports a recurrent cyst on the wrist that has reappeared after a prior surgical removal approximately 8 years ago. The cyst is associated with repetitive strain from activities such as push-ups and bench presses, which appear to exacerbate its formation. The patient notes that the cyst has recently become symptomatic, causing mild discomfort, prompting the current visit. The patient is seeking aspiration rather than surgical excision due to prior experience and preference. The patient also reports ongoing neurological symptoms in the lower leg following a prior surgery involving soft tissue neurolysis and interposition grafting, including persistent tingling and occasional electric shock-like sensations, particularly with movement or impact. The patient describes the sensations as tolerable but not painful, with no significant functional impairment. The patient is uncertain whether the symptoms are due to nerve regeneration or residual sensitivity. The patient expresses difficulty distinguishing between normal recovery and persistent pathology, noting ongoing swelling and altered sensation in the affected limb. The patient is currently undergoing rehabilitation and is considering further therapy for nerve desensitization. The patient is open to a trial of conservative management with observation and physical therapy before considering further intervention."
