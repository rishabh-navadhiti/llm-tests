        "The patient reports a recurrent cyst on the wrist that has reappeared after a prior surgical excision approximately 8 years ago. The cyst is noted to recur with repetitive wrist movements, particularly during push-ups and bench presses, suggesting mechanical exacerbation. The current lesion has become increasingly bothersome, prompting the patient to seek intervention. The patient expresses concern about the discomfort but notes it is not severe enough to warrant immediate surgery. The patient previously underwent a surgical procedure for a similar cyst and recalls the recurrence rate as approximately 10%. The patient is considering aspiration as a less invasive option, acknowledging that it may refill. The patient also reports residual symptoms from a prior nerve surgery involving the medial tibial nerve, including tingling and paresthesia, which are described as part of the nerve regeneration process. The patient notes that the sensation is not painful but is still present, particularly with certain movements or impacts. The patient is uncertain whether the symptoms are due to nerve waking up or ongoing mechanical irritation. The patient is currently undergoing physical therapy and strengthening exercises and is concerned about desensitization. The patient is open to further evaluation and treatment, including potential referral to hand therapy for nerve desensitization protocols."
