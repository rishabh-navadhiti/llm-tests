The patient expresses concern about the discomfort but notes it is not severe enough to warrant immediate surgery. The patient previously underwent a surgical procedure for a similar cyst and recalls the recurrence rate as approximately 10%.

The patient notes that the sensation is not painful but is still present, particularly with certain movements or impacts. The patient is uncertain whether the symptoms are due to nerve waking up or ongoing mechanical irritation.
