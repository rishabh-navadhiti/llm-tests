      "The patient reports a recurrent cyst on the wrist that has reappeared after a prior surgical removal approximately 8 years ago. The cyst is noted to recur with repetitive activities involving wrist extension, such as push-ups and bench presses. The patient describes the current cyst as increasingly bothersome, prompting the desire for aspiration. The patient has previously undergone surgical excision of a similar cyst and notes a residual scar. The current lesion is being evaluated for aspiration, with consideration for surgical excision if recurrence persists. The patient expresses concern about cost and insurance coverage for potential aesthetic removal. Additionally, the patient reports ongoing neurological symptoms in the lower extremity following a prior surgery, including tingling and paresthesias in the medial aspect of the knee and anterior shin, which are described as intermittent and not currently painful. The patient attributes these sensations to nerve regeneration, particularly in the context of a 5 cm interposition graft performed during the prior surgery. The patient notes that the symptoms are improving over time, with a sensation described as similar to a limb 'waking up' after being asleep. The patient is currently engaged in strengthening exercises and is concerned about desensitization and nerve-related discomfort. The patient is open to further evaluation and therapy for nerve desensitization but is currently opting for a watchful waiting approach for the lower extremity symptoms."
