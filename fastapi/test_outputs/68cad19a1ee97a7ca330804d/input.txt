### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Patient_1: Nobody ever told me that .
Doctor_1: , whoever told you
Patient_1: wrong .
Doctor_1: , let me show you . What number do you see here ?
Patient_1: course yeah , what do you say 272 . That's
Doctor_1: bad . The problem is when I see numbers like this , Mr . Catalina , you're eating things you cannot , you're not supposed to eat . Our body doesn't produce sugar . The sugar comes through the mouth , right ? And it's bread , pasta , rice , potatoes or sweets . So when I see 272 , I know that you're not eating the way you're supposed to . So for me to help you , we need to work together . But when I see that you're not , we're not working together , you're working against me .
Patient_1: guess I got my dad I . Well , you're the same . I've been fighting this diabetes forever , and I
Doctor_1: , and I , we gonna put the paper here so I can go over it with you . So I do wanna help you , but I'm not a magician . If I give you a medication and you eat sugars , I have to give you another medication and you eat more sugars , and I have to give you another medication . So what I'm giving to you is trying to fight the sugar that you're eating and that's not how it should be . It should be you work together , you follow the diet and I give you the medication to complement the diet , but unfortunately
Patient_1: only time I have a is in the morning . That's what I I have a donut . One donut .
Doctor_1: can you cannot have donuts . You're a diabetic . You can , well , you can have a donut , but then you need to get on a treadmill for 1 hour , an hour nonstop .
Patient_1: don't do that .
Doctor_1: you see my hands are tied or there's another option . I can give you a shot of insulin that you get after you you eat the donut , so you have to give yourself a shot of insulin every day . I mean , I'm offering you
Patient_1: option . I guess I , I guess I can cut the donuts down . So , So can I have toast then , right ?
Doctor_1: , toasts are carbs . What are you prepared to do physically to get rid of those calories after you eat the toast ?
Patient_1: 
Doctor_1: ,
Patient_1: ?
Doctor_1: you have time to exercise .
Patient_1: do exercise . What do
Doctor_1: mean ? No , it has to be 5 times by the American Diabetes Association .
Patient_1: my goodness . Well , I do , I do , uh . My weight , my weight . Seeing upstairs 3 times a week and I go off 3 times .
Doctor_1: you walk or do you get in the car to go ?
Patient_1: still walk over a mile .
Doctor_1: , but you do the whole green walking , right ? OK , so sugar 272 , hemoglobin A1C 8.8 , pretty bad , it should be under 7 . When I look at your last A1C previous to this one , of course , your A1C is 6.9 , so it means this is the living proof that you're eating things you're not supposed to eat , OK . When the sugars are high , the triglycerides are gonna be high . They are 288 . They should be under 150 . Now your bad cholesterol is 59 , that is good . We wanna keep it under 100 , so that part is good . And the reason why the bad cholesterol is good is because you're taking atorvastatin 40 . So , what are we gonna do today ? Uh , and also I want you to know that the uric acid is good , OK , so that part is good . So what are we gonna do today ? We're going to increase the dose of Ozempic to 2 mg . You will continue taking metformin . My advice is please eat the donuts .
Patient_1: , got it .
Doctor_1: if you eat the donut , then immediately you jump on a treadmill and you walk for an hour . But if you eat 2 donuts then you're gonna , you're gonna get on the treadmill for 2 hours . So that's a rule , one hour per suite . Of , of walking on a treadmill . But you're retired you have the time .
Patient_1: retired ,
Doctor_1: 
Patient_1: 
Doctor_1: the time to do it . So , so is , is , uh , is a matter of what you wanna do yourself . I can tell you what I can do as your doctor , which is giving you the medication . I can give you advice , but I don't have any control over the choices you make when you eat instead of the donut , get 2 eggs , add vegetables , add some protein , get some avocado . You can eat it , that is a healthy breakfast for a diabetic , but not at all .
Patient_1: can have eggs though , eggs are fine , of course . Eggs are , are , are OK . Oatmeal , oatmeal
Doctor_1: fine , yeah ,
Patient_1: .
Doctor_1: don't add any sugar to it .
