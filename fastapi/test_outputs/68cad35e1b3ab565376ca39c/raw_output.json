He acknowledges that he has been struggling with diabetes for many years and admits to not adhering to dietary recommendations. The patient is aware that his current eating habits are detrimental to his health but expresses difficulty in making lifestyle changes.

He is currently taking metformin and atorvastatin 40 mg, which helps maintain his LDL cholesterol at a favorable level (59 mg/dL). The patient is also being evaluated for ear wax impaction, which is causing hearing difficulties. He reports that his brother recently suffered a heart attack and is recovering, though he drove himself to the hospital, which the physician deemed unsafe.
