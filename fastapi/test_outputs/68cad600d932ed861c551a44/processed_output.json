They currently use braces for ambulation, particularly when walking on uneven terrain or hills. The patient is retired and not currently working. They express interest in physical therapy as a treatment option and are open to further interventions, including an MRI and possible epidural injection. The patient has not received any new medications from the provider during this visit but has previously used Tylenol and warm baths for symptom management. They are concerned about the need for stronger medications and are hesitant to use 'hardcore medicine.' The patient is awaiting approval for an injection, which is expected to be administered after authorization is obtained. The provider plans to proceed with an MRI, physical therapy, and injection once approved, with the goal of improving function and reducing pain."
