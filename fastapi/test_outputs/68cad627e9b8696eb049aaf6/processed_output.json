      "The patient reports a recurrent cyst on the wrist that has reappeared after a prior surgical removal approximately 8 years ago. The cyst is noted to recur with repetitive activities involving wrist extension, such as push-ups and bench presses. The patient describes the current cyst as increasingly bothersome, prompting the desire for aspiration. The patient has previously undergone surgical excision of a similar cyst and notes a residual scar. The current episode began after a delay in treatment, and the patient is now seeking intervention due to mild discomfort. The patient is also experiencing persistent sensory changes in the lower leg following a prior nerve surgery, including tingling, numbness, and a sensation of the leg 'falling asleep' upon waking. These symptoms are described as tolerable but not painful, with no significant functional impairment. The patient reports that the sensation in the medial aspect of the knee is improving, consistent with nerve regeneration, while the anterior shin area remains sensitive to impact. The patient is uncertain about the exact source of discomfort due to overlapping numbness and altered sensation. The patient is currently undergoing rehabilitation and strengthening exercises and is considering further evaluation for nerve desensitization. The patient is open to surgical intervention for the cyst and is concerned about insurance coverage for any aesthetic component."
