She describes the pain as localized to the front of the right thigh and associated with difficulty straightening the leg, with current strength graded at 2/5 in the right quadriceps. She has experienced 16 falls since symptom onset, including a recent fall down the stairs. The patient notes that she is unable to drive due to lack of control and requires bracing for mobility, relying on a wheelchair or chair for ambulation. She has undergone a lumbar MRI revealing significant right L3-4 stenosis, which is believed to be the underlying cause of her symptoms. Prior to this visit, she received a corticosteroid injection for suspected tendon inflammation, which provided no relief. She has also been evaluated by a neurosurgeon in 2023, who recommended a vertebroplasty or cement injection for vertebral body stabilization, but this was deferred due to concurrent radiation therapy plans. The patient has a history of breast cancer diagnosed in 2010, with recurrence in the bones in 2018. She is currently undergoing follow-up for bone metastases, with a PET scan scheduled for August 24, 2023, to assess for disease progression. She reports that prior imaging did not show active disease, but further imaging is being pursued for confirmation. The patient is concerned about the risk of fracture due to recurrent falls and is seeking definitive treatment for her spinal stenosis and potential vertebral instability. She is currently on pain medication, though specific details are not provided.
