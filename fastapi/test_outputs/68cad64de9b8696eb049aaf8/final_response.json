        "The patient reports a recurrent cyst on the wrist that has reappeared after a prior surgical removal approximately 8 years ago. The cyst is associated with repetitive strain from activities such as push-ups and bench presses, which appear to exacerbate its formation. The patient notes that the cyst has recently become symptomatic, causing mild discomfort, prompting the current visit. The patient is seeking aspiration rather than surgical excision due to concerns about cost and the desire to avoid a larger incision. The patient has previously undergone a similar procedure and is familiar with the process. The patient also reports ongoing neurological symptoms in the lower leg following a prior surgery involving neurolysis and interposition grafting, including persistent tingling and occasional discomfort, particularly with movement or impact. The patient describes the sensation as similar to a limb 'falling asleep,' with some improvement over time. The patient is uncertain whether the symptoms are due to nerve regeneration or residual sensitivity. The patient is currently undergoing rehabilitation and has been referred to occupational therapy for nerve desensitization. The patient is not currently seeking intervention for the leg symptoms, as they are tolerable and not significantly impacting daily function."
