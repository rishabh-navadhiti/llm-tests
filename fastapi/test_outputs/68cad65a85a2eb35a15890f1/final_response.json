        "The patient reports persistent right leg pain localized to the anterior thigh, associated with weakness in the right quadriceps, noted as 2/5 strength. She describes a history of lumbar stenosis at L3-4, which is contributing to her symptoms. The onset of symptoms began around late June 2023, with progressive worsening over time. She has experienced 16 falls since symptom onset, including a recent fall down the stairs. The patient reports difficulty ambulating, requiring a walker or brace for mobility, and is unable to drive due to lack of control and fear of falling. She has been unable to perform daily activities independently, necessitating hiring help for household tasks. Prior interventions include a corticosteroid injection for tendon inflammation, which provided no relief. She has also undergone evaluation by a neurosurgeon in 2023, who recommended a vertebroplasty with cement injection, but this was deferred due to concurrent radiation therapy plans. A PET scan scheduled for August 24, 2023, is being pursued to assess for metastatic disease progression. The patient has a history of breast cancer diagnosed in 2010, with recurrence in the bones in 2018. Bone metastases are currently stable on imaging, but the patient is concerned about spinal stability. She is currently under oncologic care and has not received additional radiation therapy yet. The patient expresses concern about the timing of surgical intervention and the potential for further complications if treatment is delayed."
