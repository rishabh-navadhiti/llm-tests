The patient reports difficulty ambulating, requiring a walker or brace for mobility, and is unable to drive due to lack of control and fear of falling. She has been unable to perform daily activities independently, necessitating hiring help for household tasks. Prior interventions include a corticosteroid injection for tendon inflammation, which provided no relief. She has also undergone evaluation by a neurosurgeon in 2023, who recommended a vertebroplasty with cement injection, but this was deferred due to concurrent radiation therapy plans. A PET scan scheduled for August 24, 2023, is being pursued to assess for metastatic disease progression.
