        "The patient reports persistent right leg pain localized to the anterior thigh, associated with weakness in the right quadriceps, noted as 2/5 strength. She describes a history of lumbar stenosis at L3-4, which is contributing to her symptoms. The onset of symptoms began around late June 2023, with progressive worsening over time. She has experienced 16 falls since symptom onset, including a recent fall down the stairs. The patient reports difficulty straightening her leg, inability to drive due to lack of control, and requires bracing for mobility. She has been unable to perform daily activities independently and now relies on hired help for household tasks. Prior interventions include a steroid injection for tendon inflammation, which provided no relief. She has also undergone evaluation by a neurosurgeon and radiation oncologist, with plans for a PET scan on August 24, 2023, to assess for metastatic disease progression. The patient has a history of breast cancer diagnosed in 2010, with recurrence in the bones in 2018. Bone metastases have been stable on imaging to date. The patient is currently undergoing radiation therapy and is awaiting further treatment decisions. She expresses concern about the timing of surgical intervention and the potential for spinal stabilization during surgery. She is anxious about her condition and fears further injury."
