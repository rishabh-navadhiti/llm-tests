        "The patient reports persistent right leg pain localized to the anterior thigh, associated with weakness in the right quadriceps, noted as 2/5 strength. She describes a history of progressive difficulty with ambulation, including an inability to fully straighten the right leg. The symptoms began around late June 2023, with worsening over the past three months. She has experienced 16 falls during this period, including one down the stairs, and reports significant functional impairment, requiring the use of a walker, brace, and assistance with daily activities such as driving, cooking, and cleaning. She has been unable to drive due to lack of control and fear of falling. The patient attributes her symptoms to right L3-4 spinal stenosis, confirmed on imaging. She has previously undergone a corticosteroid injection for suspected tendon inflammation, which provided no relief. She has also been evaluated by a neurosurgeon in 2023, who recommended a vertebroplasty or cement injection, but this was delayed due to concurrent radiation therapy plans. A PET scan scheduled for August 24, 2023, is being performed to assess for active metastatic disease, as she has a history of breast cancer with bone metastases in 2018. The patient is currently on bone-modifying therapy, and imaging has not shown active disease. She is concerned about the progression of her condition and the impact on her independence. Her husband, who is able to drive, is unable to assist with mobility due to his own health history, including a past injury from service in Vietnam. The patient has recently hired help for household tasks. She denies any recent trauma but suspects radiation therapy may have contributed to vertebral compromise. She expresses concern about the timing of surgical intervention and the potential for further complications if not addressed promptly."
