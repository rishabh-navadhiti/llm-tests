        "The patient reports persistent right leg pain localized to the anterior thigh, associated with weakness in the right quadriceps, noted as 2/5 strength. She describes a history of progressive difficulty with ambulation, including an inability to fully straighten the right leg. The symptoms began around late June 2023, with worsening over the past three months. She has experienced 16 falls during this period, including a fall down the stairs, and reports significant functional impairment, requiring the use of a walker, brace, and assistance with daily activities. She is unable to drive due to lack of control and fear of falling. The patient has undergone a lumbar MRI revealing severe right L3-4 stenosis, which is believed to be the underlying cause of her symptoms. Prior interventions include a corticosteroid injection for suspected tendon inflammation, which provided no relief. She has also been evaluated by a neurosurgeon and a radiation oncologist, with plans for a PET scan on August 24, 2023, to assess for possible metastatic disease progression. The patient has a history of breast cancer diagnosed in 2010, with recurrence in the bones in 2018. She is currently on bone-modifying therapy, and imaging has not shown active disease. The patient is concerned about the timing of surgical intervention due to ongoing radiation therapy and the need for further imaging. She is anxious about the possibility of further deterioration and has recently hired help for household tasks. The patientâ€™s husband, who is able to drive, is unable to assist with mobility due to his own health history, including a past injury from service in Vietnam. The patient expresses fear of breaking a bone and emphasizes the urgency of intervention."
