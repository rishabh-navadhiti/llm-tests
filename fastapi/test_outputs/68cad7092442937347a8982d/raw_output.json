Prior interventions include a corticosteroid injection for suspected tendon inflammation, which provided no relief. She has also been evaluated by a neurosurgeon and a radiation oncologist, with plans for a PET scan on August 24, 2023, to assess for possible metastatic disease progression. The patient has a history of breast cancer diagnosed in 2010, with recurrence in the bones in 2018. She is currently on bone-modifying therapy, and imaging has not shown active disease. The patient is concerned about the timing of surgical intervention due to ongoing radiation therapy and the need for further imaging. She is anxious about the possibility of further deterioration and has recently hired help for household tasks.
