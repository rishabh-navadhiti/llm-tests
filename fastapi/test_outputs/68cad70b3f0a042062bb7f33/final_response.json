The pain has been persistent and ongoing, with no significant improvement despite use of supportive measures such as braces and over-the-counter pain relief. The patient describes a history of a detached disc on one side and a torn disc on the other side of the lumbar spine. They currently use braces for ambulation, particularly during activities such as walking in hilly terrain. The patient is retired and not currently working. They express interest in physical therapy as a treatment option and are open to further interventions, including an MRI and potential epidural injection. The patient has not received any new medications from the provider during this visit. They previously used Tylenol and warm baths for symptom management. The patient is concerned about the need for an MRI and the timeline for treatment approval. They are awaiting approval for an injection, which the provider explained may involve sedation and temporary incapacitation. The patient is scheduled to return in October for follow-up. The patient also mentions a prior visit where they were advised to undergo an MRI, which was not completed at that time. The provider emphasized the importance of timely check-ins and real-time updates during visits."
