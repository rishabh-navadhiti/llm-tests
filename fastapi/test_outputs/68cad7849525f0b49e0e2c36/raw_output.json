The patient has previously undergone surgical excision of a similar cyst and notes a residual scar. The current episode began after a delay in treatment, and the patient is now seeking intervention due to mild discomfort. The patient is also experiencing persistent sensory changes in the lower leg following a prior nerve surgery, including tingling, numbness, and a sensation of the leg 'falling asleep' upon movement. These symptoms are attributed to nerve regeneration, particularly in the medial aspect of the knee, where an interposition graft was performed. The patient reports that the sensation is tolerable and not painful, but still noticeable. The patient is uncertain whether the symptoms are due to nerve regeneration or muscle constriction. The patient is currently undergoing physical therapy and strengthening exercises, which may exacerbate symptoms.
