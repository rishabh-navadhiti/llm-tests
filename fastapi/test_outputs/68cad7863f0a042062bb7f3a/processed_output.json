      "The patient reports persistent right leg pain localized to the anterior thigh, associated with weakness in the right quadriceps, noted as 2/5 strength. She describes a history of progressive difficulty with ambulation, including an inability to fully straighten the right leg. The symptoms began around late June 2023, with worsening over the past three months. She has experienced 16 falls during this period, including a recent fall down the stairs. The patient reports that the pain is exacerbated by standing or walking and is relieved by rest. She has been unable to drive due to lack of control and requires bracing for mobility. She has attempted physical therapy and a corticosteroid injection for tendon inflammation, which provided no lasting benefit. The patient also reports ongoing back pain, which she attributes to her history of metastatic breast cancer to the bones, diagnosed in 2018. She has been under oncologic follow-up and is currently undergoing surveillance with a PET scan scheduled for August 24, 2023, to assess for disease progression. She previously declined a vertebroplasty procedure due to radiation therapy requirements, which delayed intervention. The patient is concerned about the risk of fracture and is currently receiving bone-modifying therapy. She is emotionally distressed by her declining mobility and the burden of care on her husband, who is unable to assist with ambulation despite being able to drive. She has recently hired help for household tasks due to functional limitations."
