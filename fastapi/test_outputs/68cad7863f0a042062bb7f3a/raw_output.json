The patient reports that the pain is exacerbated by standing or walking and is relieved by rest. She has been unable to drive due to lack of control and requires bracing for mobility. She has attempted physical therapy and a corticosteroid injection for tendon inflammation, which provided no lasting benefit. The patient also reports ongoing back pain, which she attributes to her history of metastatic breast cancer to the bones, diagnosed in 2018.

She previously declined a vertebroplasty procedure due to radiation therapy requirements, which delayed intervention. The patient is concerned about the risk of fracture and is currently receiving bone-modifying therapy.
