They currently use braces for ambulation, particularly during activities such as walking in hilly terrain. The patient is retired and not currently working. They express interest in physical therapy as a treatment option and are open to further interventions, including an MRI and potential epidural injection. The patient has not received any new medications from the provider during this visit. They previously used Tylenol and warm baths for symptom management.
