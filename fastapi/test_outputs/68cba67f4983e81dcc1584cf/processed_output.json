      "The patient is a 75-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes, as evidenced by a blood glucose level of 272 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 8.8%, which is significantly above the target of less than 7%. The patient reports consuming a donut daily in the morning, which contributes to elevated blood sugar levels. He acknowledges that he has been struggling with diabetes for many years and admits to not adhering to dietary recommendations. He is aware that his current eating habits, particularly the intake of high-carbohydrate foods such as donuts and toast, are exacerbating his hyperglycemia. The patient is motivated to make changes and expresses willingness to reduce donut consumption. He is also aware of the need for physical activity, though he currently engages in walking approximately three times per week, covering over a mile each time. The patient denies pain or discomfort in his joints but has been diagnosed with osteoarthritis, which he attributes to normal wear and tear. He reports no recent changes in hearing, but the physician notes impacted cerumen in both ears, which is causing partial hearing loss. The patientâ€™s brother recently suffered a heart attack and is recovering, which the patient views as a concerning family health event. The patient is currently on metformin and has been prescribed an increase in Ozempic dose to 2 mg. He is also advised to undergo a diabetic eye exam, which he last had one year ago. The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 4 months, with a prior appointment in 1 week for cerumen removal."
