The patient acknowledges consuming a donut and coffee daily in the morning, which contributes to elevated glucose levels. He admits to not adhering to dietary recommendations, stating he has been fighting diabetes for years. The patient has a history of elevated triglycerides at 288 mg/dL, which are above the recommended level of under 150 mg/dL. He denies symptoms of neuropathy or other complications but reports stiffness and firmness in the fingers, which the physician attributes to non-rheumatic arthritis. The patient also reports persistent ear clogging and decreased hearing, which the physician identifies as due to impacted cerumen. He denies pain from the hand findings. The patient is retired and exercises three times per week, though the physician recommends five times weekly per American Diabetes Association guidelines. The patient is motivated to improve his diet and has agreed to discontinue donuts and adopt healthier breakfast options such as eggs, vegetables, avocado, and unsweetened oatmeal. He is compliant with Metformin and Atorvastatin. The physician emphasizes the importance of dietary adherence and physical activity to achieve glycemic control and reduce cardiovascular risk."
