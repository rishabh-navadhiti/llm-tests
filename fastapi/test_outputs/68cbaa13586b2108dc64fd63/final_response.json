        "Benjamin Posey, a pediatric patient, presents with a right index finger fracture sustained during a fall. The injury occurred while rollerblading, resulting in the need for a cast. He has been wearing a cast for several weeks and reports that he is tired of it. He notes that immediately after removing the cast, there was a slight reduction in range of motion; however, he feels improved mobility even 10 minutes later, indicating early recovery. He denies significant pain at the time of the visit. The fracture is located at the base of the proximal phalanx and is classified as a buckle fracture. The patient is currently in the healing phase, with radiographic evidence of remodeling and stabilization. There is no tenderness on palpation, and he is able to make a fist with full extension. The patient is eager to resume normal activities, including school and physical play, but is advised to avoid high-impact sports and contact activities for the next two weeks to minimize the risk of refracture. The father expresses concern about long-term growth plate development, though the physician reassures that the current X-ray findings show normal physis and healing. No other associated symptoms such as swelling, discoloration, or neurovascular compromise are reported."
