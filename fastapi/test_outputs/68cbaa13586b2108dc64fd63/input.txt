As a seasoned medical scribe specializing in the SOAP template, your task is to transform the transcription of the doctor-patient conversation into a structured patient visit note, you will also be provided with a pre charting notes , use that as context for the notes.. This note must adhere to the doctor's preferred format, ensuring that all crucial details are captured without the doctor needing to personally document them. Your expertise lies in understanding medical terminology and effectively conveying information in a professional tone. Each section of the patient visit note, such as History of Present Illness and Past Medical History, corresponds to a specific object in the JSON template provided by the doctor. If specific information is absent from the conversation, you will incorporate the default value specified in each template section. Ensure that the final output is formatted as a JSON array of objects, maintaining the same exact order and format as the given doctor’s preferred template. Be meticulous in avoiding any grammatical errors and ensure all sentences are correctly punctuated. This will allow for seamless integration for further processing, such as parsing into an array of objects using Python programming language. Please recheck the sentence and correct any grammatical errors in the following medical-related template. Ensure clarity, professionalism, and proper medical terminology while maintaining a concise and structured format

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: Rupa. Okay, we're going to see Benjamin Posey. She's on Spencer's schedule at 8:45, okay? Good.
Family_member_1: Good morning.
Doctor_1: Morning. How are you? I'm doing well. How are you?
Family_member_1: You're getting in one of our good days.
Doctor_1: Yeah, I was going to say.
Family_member_1: Yeah. Thank you very much.
Doctor_1: Hi. Of course. How are you? How are things?
Family_member_1: Doing okay. Okay.
Doctor_1: Your cat got your tongue, you don't want to talk?
Family_member_1: Going good.
Doctor_1: It's okay, you can say hi.
Family_member_1: You say good morning? Good morning.
Doctor_1: Mm.
Family_member_1: You a little shy? You a little shy?
Doctor_1: No.
Family_member_1: Yeah, okay. I'm gonna show your finger. Do you like it?
Doctor_1: What's on your shirt? Tell me about your shirt. You like forests?
Family_member_1: He wants to be an artist when he grows up.
Doctor_1: Oh, that's cool. So which do you like better, the bear or the... Is that an elk or a deer? The elk one. The deer, okay. You like the deer better? Not the bear? Do bears scare you? No? They scare me. I think that's a picture of one. No, the picture. That's better. That's better.
Family_member_1: He's got a beast, though. He has eight brothers, so he's got to go beat them up.
Doctor_1: How, where are you in the lineup? I'm a lion. Oh. Do your older brothers pick on you? They did.
Family_member_1: I don't know, he doesn't stand for that.
Doctor_1: Yeah? You fight back? What about your younger brothers? Are you mean to your little brothers? He sounds like an animal. They, you know, I, I appreciate that.
Family_member_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: Wait, so, so if you're like mean to your little brothers, then how come you're too afraid to talk to me? You're a tough guy, right? No?
Family_member_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: You're a nice guy?
Family_member_1: You're very nice guy.
Doctor_1: You take good care of them, right?
Family_member_1: Mm-hmm.
Doctor_1: As long as they understand that you're, you know, bigger, stronger, faster-
Family_member_1: They gotta listen.
Doctor_1: ... they gotta listen, right?
Family_member_1: Trying to minimize the fact that we don't want there to be trauma forever going rollerblading again after this.
Doctor_1: Oh, no. Come on, you gotta go rollerblading. It's so much fun. How does it feel? How much pain are you having right now?
Family_member_1: Here right now, you're in a lot of pain?
Doctor_1: Um-hmm. Can you make a fist for me? Okay, good. Open all the way.
Family_member_1: He was saying that like right after he took it off, there's a little less range of motion and he feels like there's more range of motion even 10 minutes later.
Doctor_1: Yep, to the magic of being young.
Family_member_1: Exactly.
Doctor_1: If it was you or me, we'd be like moving, he'd be like... And that's the way that it is.
Family_member_1: Okay. Okay.
Doctor_1: So let's see.
Family_member_1: What color was your first cast? Blue, and now you got a red one?
Doctor_1: Any pain when I push? Good. And no pain up here, right? No pain when I go like this? A little stretching. What? A little stretching.
Family_member_1: Feel like it's stretching?
Doctor_1: Yeah, good. Um, let me show you...
Family_member_1: It's your fingers. Believe it.
Doctor_1: So, we look at ... Sort of like, I think, you know, the, you can kind of see it's like right along here, it's just a little bit of a buckle fracture.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: This is where he's growing from.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: We protected it 'cause it's near the, where he's growing from-
Family_member_1: Sure.
Doctor_1: ... but if you look at how it's going, and you look at even how, you know, how he's healing, you can see that it's actually already smoothing out here.
Family_member_1: Great.
Doctor_1: And you can see the extra bone as he's remodeling it.
Family_member_1: Wow.
Doctor_1: It does go all, it does go all the way across here, but, um, everything looks nice and stable. The physis looks wonderful.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: He's not tender on palpation. I, I look at this and I go, I think we can transition him to some buddy straps or something-
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: ... to sort of give him a little bit of protection, but not too much.
Family_member_1: So just like bare tape?
Doctor_1: Yeah, just some tape.
Family_member_1: And for how long?
Doctor_1: Couple weeks.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Now, obviously any time that you come out of a cast and you have a fracture-
Family_member_1: Mm-hmm.
Doctor_1: ... there's always a risk of refracture.
Family_member_1: Right.
Doctor_1: So, 'cause it just doesn't move naturally, but you can see he's already moving better. Um, so I would just be mindful and watchful of it.
Family_member_1: Right.
Doctor_1: But you, I mean, probably won't be able to slow him down all that much.
Family_member_1: Exactly, and writing and all of that.
Doctor_1: Yeah. Do his, do your thing.
Family_member_1: Do, just do regular life.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Sound good?
Family_member_1: Sound good, buddy?
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Family_member_1: Showering? No, no, we just want to put tape. You can shower, you can do everything regular now.
Doctor_1: Oh. Yeah.
Family_member_1: How was that?
Doctor_1: The only, the only thing I would probably avoid for the next two weeks would be like tetherball, basketball, rollerskating- Yeah, is soccer. I thought that was out.
Family_member_1: Hm?... even his tetherball, okay? So we're good.
Doctor_1: Old. I love them.
Family_member_1: I know. I love them exactly-
Doctor_1: You know what tetherball is.
Family_member_1: ... a big hole-
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Family_member_1: ... with the thing, and you hit it, and then you think about how-
Doctor_1: They, they probably took those out. They're probably-
Family_member_1: Yeah, they have it at our, on our block, yep.
Doctor_1: Okay.
Family_member_1: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It was probably, it's probably, probably starts too many fights with that. So things that are involving direct, heavy-
Doctor_1: Just, just sort of like, you know-
Family_member_1: ... like contact-
Doctor_1: ... big, heavy balls, probably not the best right now.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: But maybe just a couple weeks. They, they actually look fantastic, so I'm not even-
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: If I were worried about it, I'd put them back in a cast. I, I'm not worried about it. I just, you know, wanna minimize you having to come back.
Family_member_1: Sure.
Doctor_1: And then the only other thing that I would do is I'd say come back in, like four to six weeks.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Um, probably one, one last X-ray just to make sure that-
Family_member_1: Great.
Doctor_1: ... you've sort of gotten outside of the injury window.
Family_member_1: Sure. We'll see
Doctor_1: We can verify that the, that the physis is in fact doing what it's supposed to-
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: ... growing. Keep on growing.
Family_member_1: Good job. Do we have any sense from these type of things, or it's, it would be a different X-ray-
Doctor_1: No.
Family_member_1: ... about, like is overall growth plate and how tall and how, that kind of stuff, or?
Doctor_1: Uh, you can-
Family_member_1: Age appropriate?
Doctor_1: You can, on hand X-rays, which, you know, again, when you look at, when you, when you look at this, these are finger X-rays, not hand X-rays.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: On hand X-rays, you can, um, there are ways to determine bone age, um, but even that we can, you know, we can't look at just a single finger-
Family_member_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: ... X-ray. Um, are you concerned about that?
Family_member_1: With some of other kids, so that's one of the things-
Doctor_1: Um, I, I, you know, there... The pediatric orthopedic surgeons usually do more of those. They, they tend to do that. And then there's also, if there's concern about hormone imbalances and things like that-
Family_member_1: Right.
Doctor_1: ... there are pediatric endocrinologists.
Family_member_1: Thanks for that. Yeah.
Doctor_1: Unfortunately, I just do the book. The fixing. I do the fixing.
Family_member_1: Right, no, but I think, yeah, I don't think any particular concern, you know, it could be-
Doctor_1: I don't see-
Family_member_1: ... I don't think so for six to eight weeks.
Doctor_1: I don't, well, I- Um, you know, good health, good, good protein intake, all that kind of business.
Family_member_1: Yeah, and genes, yeah.
Doctor_1: And gene, these are the most important, but, but when we look at this, it looks like that.
Family_member_1: Okay, perfect. Really, really appreciate it.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Family_member_1: Thank you so much. You said big thank you.
Doctor_1: Thank you.
Family_member_1: Okay. Give me a handshake. We appreciate it so much, Doctor.
Doctor_1: Look at that. He's like, "Bone, bone, bone." Hold on, I'll get you those, those buddy tapes, okay?
Family_member_1: Okay, great. Thank you.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Family_member_1: Please. You print it, Dr. Gutita?
Doctor_1: You're good. No, you're good. Okay, so, uh, finger fracture, um, we're gonna transition to buddy straps, so if you just get him a pair of buddy straps. Actually, just get him, like, like just put one right here is perfect.
Family_member_1: Okay. Just one? Okay.
Doctor_1: Yeah, just one, 'cause his fracture's down here, so-
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Just, so a buddy strap, um, and then follow up in four to six weeks. Uh, he did so, uh, HPI, he's doing better. Um, his pain is doing better. He's really tired of the cast. Uh, on physical exam, uh, there's no soft tissue swelling. There's no tenderness palpatation at the index finger proximal phalanx. His rotation appears appropriate, and he is able to make a fist. Um, neurovasculature tact distally, X-rays. Um, three views of the, uh, right index finger were ordered, commentated, and reviewed with the patient and father that demonstrate uh, remodeling of the proximal phalanx base consistent with good fracture healing. Uh, plan, um, so regarding the right index finger, uh, proximal phalanx fracture, reviewed the X-rays, um, with the patient and father, uh, he is showing good signs of healing. Recommend protect with buddy straps times two weeks, then wean. Uh, recommend avoid ball sports or contact sports for the next two weeks. Uh, we talked about the risk of refracture. Uh, recommend follow-up in four to six weeks for X-rays to evaluate the physis.
