      "The patient reports a history of poorly controlled diabetes, with a current blood glucose level of 272 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 8.8%, which is significantly elevated above the target of less than 7%. The patient acknowledges that his glucose levels have worsened since his previous HbA1c of 6.9%. He admits to consuming a daily donut with coffee in the morning, which the physician identifies as a major contributor to his hyperglycemia. The patient also reports elevated triglycerides at 288 mg/dL, which are above the recommended threshold of 150 mg/dL. He denies symptoms of neuropathy or other diabetic complications but reports persistent ear wax buildup causing hearing impairment. The patient is retired and exercises three times per week, though the physician recommends increasing physical activity to five times per week per American Diabetes Association guidelines. The patient expresses willingness to modify his diet, including eliminating donuts and substituting with eggs, vegetables, avocado, and unsweetened oatmeal. He is aware of the need for lifestyle changes and medication adherence. The physician emphasizes that medication alone cannot compensate for poor dietary choices and stresses the importance of patient cooperation in managing diabetes. The patient is also referred for a diabetic eye exam due to lack of recent documentation from his previous provider."
