        "Benjamin Posey, a pediatric patient, sustained a right index finger fracture, which was initially managed with a cast. He reports that immediately after cast removal, there was a slight reduction in range of motion, with increased stiffness noted approximately 10 minutes later. He has experienced improvement in mobility and pain over time, with no current tenderness on palpation. The patient is eager to resume normal activities, including school and physical play, but is concerned about re-injury. He is currently in good spirits and cooperative during the visit. The family reports that he is tired of wearing the cast and is motivated to return to regular activities. The fracture is located in the proximal phalanx near the growth plate, and imaging demonstrates early signs of remodeling and stable healing. The patient is not currently experiencing significant pain during daily activities."
