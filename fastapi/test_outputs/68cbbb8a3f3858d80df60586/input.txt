Family_member_1: It sounds like it is
Doctor_1: , you know , I , I appreciate that . Wait , so , so if you're like me to your little brothers , then how come you're too afraid to talk to me ? You're a tough guy , right ?
Family_member_1: ,
Doctor_1: ,
Family_member_1: a nice guy . You're very nice .
Doctor_1: take good care of him ,
Family_member_1: ?
Doctor_1: long as they understand that you're , you know , bigger , stronger , faster ,
Family_member_1: listen .
Doctor_1: gotta listen , right ?
Family_member_1: to minimize the fact that we don't want there to be trauma forever going again after this .
Doctor_1: no , come on , you gotta go rollerblading . So much fun . How does it feel ? How much pain are you having right now ?
Family_member_1: , right now , you're in a lot of pain ? Um ,
Doctor_1: you
Family_member_1: 
Doctor_1: fist for me ? OK , good , open all the way .
Family_member_1: was saying that like right after they took it off there's a little less range of motion and he feels like there's more in 10 minutes later , yeah ,
Doctor_1: the magic of being young exactly if it was you or me we'd be like moving we like .
Family_member_1: .
Doctor_1: that's the way that it is , OK . OK .
Family_member_1: let's see . What was your first cast . Hello and now you got the right one .
Doctor_1: pain when I push ? Good . And no pain up here , right ? The pain when I go like this . No stretching ? Little stretching .
Family_member_1: like it's stretching . Yeah , good . Um ,
Doctor_1: me show you .
Family_member_1: your fingers . Believe it ?
Doctor_1: we look at Sort of like , I think , you know , the You can kind of see it's like right along here . It's just a little bit of a buckle fracture . This is where he's growing from . We protected it because it's near the where he's growing from , but if you look at how it's going and you look at even how You know how he's healing , you can see that it's actually already smoothing out here . Great , and you can see the extra bone as he's remodeling it . Wow , it does go , it does go all the way across here , but , um , everything looks nice and stable . The ices looks wonderful . OK . But he's not tender on palpation . I , I look at this and I go , I think we can transition into some body straps or something sort of in a little bit of protection , but not too much .
Family_member_1: ,
Doctor_1: some tape .
Family_member_1: for how long ?
Doctor_1: weeks .
Family_member_1: .
Doctor_1: , obviously , anytime that you come out of a cast , and you have a fracture , there's always a risk of re fracture , right ? So cause it just doesn't move naturally , but you can see he's already moving better . Um , so I would just be mindful and watchful of it , right ? But you , I mean probably won't be able to slow
Family_member_1: all that . Exactly , and writing and all of that .
Doctor_1: , do , do your thing .
Family_member_1: just do regular life . Yeah , OK . Sound good , sound good , buddy ? Shower now , we just want to put tape . You can shower , you can do everything regular now .
Doctor_1: , the only , the only thing I would probably avoid for the next two weeks would be like tetherball , basketball , roller skating ,
Family_member_1: , even his tether ball , OK , so we're going . I know you know tether ball is a big out there probably , yeah , they have it at our on our block , yeah , OK , yeah .
Doctor_1: probably , it's probably , probably starts too many fights with that .
Family_member_1: things that are involving direct just
Doctor_1: sort of like , you know , big heavy balls , probably not the best right now . OK , just a couple of weeks . They , they actually look fantastic . So I'm not even , if I were worried about it , I put them back in the cast . I'm not happy about it . I just , you know , wanna minimize you having to come back . And then the only other thing that I would do is I'd say come back in like 4 to 6 weeks , um , probably 11 last X-ray just to make sure that we've sort of gotten outside of the injury window , or we can verify that the , that the ice is in fact doing what it's supposed to and growing . Keep on growing . Good
Family_member_1: . Do we have any sense from these type of things or it would be a different X-ray about like is all growth plane and how tall and how that kind of stuff or ,
Doctor_1: , you can , you can , on hand X-rays , which , you know , again , when you look at when you You look at this , these are finger X-rays , not hand X-rays . On hand X-rays , you can , um , there are ways to determine bone age , um , but even that , we can , you know , we can't look at just a single finger X-ray . Um , are you concerned about that ? With
Family_member_1: of the other kids . So that's
Doctor_1: , I , I , you know , there , the pediatric orthopedic surgeons usually do more of those . They , they tend to do that . And then there's also , if there's concern about hormone imbalances and things like that ,
Family_member_1: are . Piatric endocrinologist , unfortunately , I just do it . I do to fix it , right ? No , but I think , yeah , I , I don't think any particular concern , you know , I I don't see I don't , well , um , you know ,
Doctor_1: health , good , good protein intake , all the , yeah , and .
Family_member_1: when we look at this , it looks like that . OK , perfect . Really , really appreciate it . Thank you so much . You said a big thank you . OK , give me a handshake . We appreciate he's like boom boom boom . Hold on ,
Doctor_1: get you those those buddy tapes , OK , OK ,
Family_member_1: . Uh But Prin it Doctor Yochida .
Doctor_1: can know it , you're good . OK , so , uh , finger fracture , um , we're gonna transition to body straps . So if you can just get him a pair of buddy straps . Actually , just get him like , just put one right here . It's perfect . Just one , yeah , just one , because this fracture is down here . So this is a buddy strap , um , and then follow up in 4 to 6 weeks . Uh , he , so , uh , HPI is doing better , um . His pain is doing better . He's really tired of the cast , uh , on physical exam . Uh there's no soft tissue swelling , there's no tenderness palpation . At the index finger of proximal phalanx . His rotation appears appropriate , and he is able to make a fist . Um , Neurovascular tact distally X-rays . Um , Previews of the Uh , right index finger were ordered to come take a review of the patient and father that demonstrate . A remodeling of the proximal phalanx space consistent with good fracture healing . Uh , plan , um , So regarding the right index finger , uh , proximal phalanx fracture , we reviewed the X-rays . Um , with a patient and father , uh , he is showing good signs of healing . Recommend protect with body straps 2 weeks , then wean , uh , recommend avoid ball sports or contact sports for the next 2 weeks . Uh , we talked about the risk of refracture , uh , recommend follow-up in 4 to 6 weeks for x-rays to evaluate the ices .
