        "The patient is a 70-year-old individual with a history of progressive spinal deformity and chronic back pain, reporting difficulty with ambulation and limited range of motion. The patient states they can only move in one direction and experience persistent pain even when lying down. They report using a walker for ambulation and are unable to walk for extended periods. The pain is localized to the lower back and radiates to the area around the spine, with the patient noting that the spine appears crooked. The patient also reports concurrent knee and ankle pain, with the left knee being shorter and causing a gait imbalance. The patient notes that the condition has worsened over time, with symptoms including pain while sitting and the need to frequently shift position. The patient expresses concern about the possibility of surgical intervention and has previously declined surgery due to fear. The patient has not had prior imaging for this issue, but an MRI performed on August 29, 2025, at AMI revealed mild spinal stenosis at L3-L4, severe disc disease from L1 to S1, and no significant stenosis in the cervical spine. The patient is aware of the degenerative nature of the condition and the potential for progression. They are concerned about long-term mobility and quality of life. The patient is currently considering treatment options, including epidural injections and possible future spinal surgery. The patient also has a history of a prior laparoscopic abdominal surgery and is scheduled for a knee surgery consultation with Dr. O'Dowd next week."
