        "The patient reports chronic back pain that worsens with movement and persists even when lying down. She has difficulty walking and requires a walker for ambulation. She notes pain in the lower back and bilateral lower extremities, with the left side appearing shorter. The pain is exacerbated by sitting and standing, and she experiences discomfort when attempting to straighten her spine. She has a history of knee and ankle problems, with the left knee showing valgus deformity. The patient has not undergone prior spinal surgery and is concerned about her ability to return to a straight posture. She has not had prior imaging for this issue, but an MRI dated August 29, 2025, revealed mild spinal stenosis at L3-L4, severe disc disease from L1 to S1, and no significant stenosis in the cervical spine. She reports that her symptoms have progressively worsened over time, with increasing difficulty in mobility and daily function. She is currently not receiving effective relief from conservative measures and is considering surgical intervention for her degenerative scoliosis."
