        "Benjamin Kapolunick presented for follow-up with a history of a hand fracture. He reported that he is doing OK and has removed his previous splint, which was replaced with a new one. He expressed confusion and frustration that his hand is fractured rather than his finger. On physical examination, the incision site showed no complications, and sutures were removed. The ring finger demonstrated correct rotation, but there was significant stiffness in the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. X-rays confirmed stable alignment with a fracture that remains stable. The patient is currently on a thermoplastic splint, undergoing hand therapy, and advised to maintain non-weight bearing status. Follow-up is scheduled in four weeks for repeat X-rays or range of motion assessment."
