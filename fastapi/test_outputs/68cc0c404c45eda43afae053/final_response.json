She has difficulty walking, requiring a walker, and can only walk short distances from the kitchen to the restroom and sofa. She reports pain while sitting and changing positions frequently. The pain is located in the lower back and radiates to the sides, with the spine appearing crooked. She has a history of knee and ankle problems, and her left knee is shorter than the right, contributing to imbalance. She has fallen twice due to instability. She has not responded to previous therapies and is concerned about her ability to undergo surgery. She has a cervical spine MRI showing severe disc disease at C5-C7 with no stenosis, and a lumbar spine MRI showing severe disc disease from L1 to S1 with mild central stenosis at L3-L4. She is currently considering treatment options, including epidural injections and potential surgery."
