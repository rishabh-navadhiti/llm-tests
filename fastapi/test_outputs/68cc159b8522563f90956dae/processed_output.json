      "The patient reports progressive weakness in the right upper extremity, with inability to use the index finger and thumb, and limited ability to spread the fingers. He notes muscle wasting in the right hand, particularly in the thenar and hypothenar muscles and the first dorsal interosseous, as well as in the forearm. He describes a flexion contracture of the ring and small fingers. He denies pain in the affected arm or neck, but acknowledges a history of multiple car accidents, including over 10 rear-end collisions, which he believes contributed to cumulative spinal damage. He has no leg weakness or pain. He has not been taking medications for pain. He reports that he can no longer touch the affected side as he could previously and notes that the right side is significantly weaker compared to the left, which remains normal. He has a scheduled EMG for November 4th, but the doctor recommends proceeding with surgery without waiting for the test."
