      "The patient reports persistent pain on the left side that radiates down the front of the thigh. The pain was initially localized to the area of the first injection and raised concern for a blood clot, which was ruled out with ultrasound. The right leg is described as dull and numb, without weakness. The patient uses a walker and can walk for approximately 10 minutes. The pain on the left side has worsened recently, with the right side now exhibiting increased numbness and pain. The patient previously experienced 100% relief from a lumbar epidural steroid injection at L2-3 four months ago, which lasted for a few months before symptoms recurred. The patient has a history of multiple sclerosis and a prior L3-L5 spinal fusion. The neurologist has attributed the right-sided symptoms to MS and the left-sided symptoms to both MS and lumbar spine pathology. The patient is currently on Gabapentin, which has alleviated the electric-type pain on the right side, and is following an exercise program. She is seeking a repeat injection at L2-3 due to recurrence of symptoms."
