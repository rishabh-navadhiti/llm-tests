He presented to urgent care on 09/17/25, where he was diagnosed with left de Quervain's tenosynovitis and prescribed a splint and ice. X-rays of the left wrist were performed at that time and were reported as normal. He has since been using a thumb spica brace, icing, and taking Naproxen. He reports improvement in symptoms. He is scheduled to travel to Japan in three weeks for a bicycle trip and will return for an injection if significant pain develops before then."
