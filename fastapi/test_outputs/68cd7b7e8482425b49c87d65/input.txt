ROLE: You are an expert medical scribe.
TASK: Extract structured medical information from a doctor-patient conversation transcript and populate a provided JSON template.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  **Output Format:** You MUST output a JSON array of objects that exactly matches the structure, keys, and order of the provided template.
2.  **Filling the Template:** For each object in the template, you must fill the `"content"` field based *only* on the transcript, strictly following the `"instruction"` for that field.
3.  **Source Material:** Use ONLY the information explicitly stated in the provided medical transcript. Do not infer, assume, or add any information not present in the transcript.
4.  **Handling Missing Data:** If no relevant information is found in the transcript for a specific field, you must use the `"default"` value provided for that field in the template.
5.  **Verbatim vs. Interpretation:**
    - For fields requiring verbatim extraction, extract the doctor's words exactly as dictated.
    - For fields requiring summarization, synthesize the information into a concise, professional clinical note.
    - Use clinical judgment ONLY to correct unambiguous errors (e.g., a likely misstated joint name if the context is 100% clear). Do not change terms without strong justification.
6.  **Final Output:** Your entire response must be ONLY the completed JSON array. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown code blocks.

### INSTRUCTIONS:
Extract information from the medical transcript below and populate the JSON template. Be precise and only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the transcript. Do not add any information that is not present in the transcript.

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: All right, she has zero pain down her right arm now, and she has a little tight and, um, achy on the right side of her neck. But that's mild. She's not taking any meds at all. She's very happy with the start of therapy. An exam is normal, except a little bit of tenderness on the right side of her neck and trapezius muscle. So at this time she's got cervical stenosis, disc herniations, and she did great with one, uh, injection on the right side at C5-C7. ??? will do therapy, uh, give her a lot of calm patches. She'll take Gabapentin and follow up in four months to see if there are any issues.
Patient_1: Okay, Dr. Lee. Thank you.

### OUTPUT:
Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the template structure above. Do not include any explanations, commentary, or additional text outside the JSON structure.
