        "A 54-year-old female journalist presents with a history of a right ring finger injury sustained on 7/2025 after falling while walking her dog. She reports swelling in the right index, middle, and ring fingers, along with a history of catching and curvature of the PIP joint of the left middle finger. She notes morning stiffness in the affected fingers, difficulty uncurling them, and weakness in the left hand. She reports a prior episode of trigger finger in the left middle finger that resolved with OT and exercises. The current issue began after the fall, with persistent swelling and stiffness, particularly in the morning. She has no pain but is concerned about functional limitations, especially with writing and typing. She underwent X-rays on 7/22/25 at Kaiser, which showed no acute fracture or dislocation, normal bone quality, and no severe degenerative changes. She has a history of mild carpal tunnel syndrome and frozen shoulder in her 40s, both resolved. She denies prior trigger finger but notes morning hand clenching and stress. She has been doing home exercises and night splinting. She switched insurance and sought care at this clinic after initial evaluation by a GP and OT."

What about here? Nope. Not too bad? Like, the slightest bit. Like, um, they did the x-rays wondering if maybe arthritis caused trigger fingers. So that's why they had done the x-rays, but they didn't find anything. I did also bring some printouts of my blood work. 'Cause they were wondering about diabetes, but then that... you know, all the things. Sure. Does that bother you? That's not too bad? Nothing. And the little finger also not too bad? No. Good. Okay. The only... On my right hand, I've only noticed something in the middle three fingers. In, in these three? Yeah. Okay, got it. Mostly in the middle? Yeah, right when I wake up. Uh, make a tight fist for me. Okay. Do you feel a pull when you do that or not too bad? Nothing. Okay, got it. Let me see that side over there. Um, and also, Karen, no tenderness, uh... Sorry, mild tenderness about the PIP joint of the... It was this one, right? Of the ring... Yeah, I think it was. The ring finger. That's the one I fell on. Yeah. Yeah, got it. You know what? I, I should note, when I was starting OT and she felt this hand... she felt like this one seemed like it was starting... And, Karen, on the left side, uh, skin intact, no soft tissue swelling, uh, no tenderness over A1 pulley of middle finger. I would say a able to get to zero degrees at PIP joint of middle finger. Can you make a full fist? Yeah. I'm squeezing really tight... but open your thumb... your index finger... your little finger... ring finger, and now the middle finger. It, it triggered a little. Yeah. Okay, um... we'll say positive triggering of middle finger."
