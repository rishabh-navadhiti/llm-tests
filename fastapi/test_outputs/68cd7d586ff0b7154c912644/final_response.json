She notes the sensation is present during certain movements but is not constant. The low back pain has improved but is not fully resolved; she reports a mild twinge in the right buttock area, possibly related to lifting a heavy pot. She denies any radiating pain to the thighs, legs, or arms. She is not taking any pain medications and reports good function with walking, standing, and performing exercises. She has been doing yoga and has improved strength and mobility, particularly with engaging her lower abdomen during leg lifts. She has a history of cervical radiculopathy and isthmic spondylolisthesis. The patient is currently experiencing approximately 90% relief from symptoms following injections, with no significant limitations in daily activities."
