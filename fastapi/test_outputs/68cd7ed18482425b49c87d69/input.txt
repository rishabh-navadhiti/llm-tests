ROLE: You are an expert medical scribe.
TASK: Extract structured medical information from a doctor-patient conversation transcript and populate a provided JSON template.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

Output Format

You MUST output a JSON array of objects that exactly matches the structure, keys, and order of the provided template.

Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting.

Filling the Template

For each object in the template, fill the "content" field strictly based on the transcript, following the "instruction" for that field.

Use ONLY information explicitly stated in the transcript.

Handling Missing Data

If no relevant information is present in the transcript for a field, return the "default" value exactly as provided in the template.

Verbatim vs. Summarization

For fields requiring verbatim extraction, copy the doctor’s words exactly as dictated.

For fields requiring summarization, rewrite into a concise, professional clinical note.

Do not infer or assume information beyond what is clearly stated.

Capitalization Rules (MANDATORY)

Always capitalize the first letter of any body part, anatomical structure, or specific location.

Includes: Skin, Nail, Finger, Hand, Wrist, Forearm, Elbow, Shoulder, Clavicle, Chest, Abdomen, Hip, Thigh, Knee, Leg, Ankle, Foot, Toe, Neck, Back, Spine, Head, Face, Eye, Ear, Nose, Mouth, Tongue, Jaw, and all joint names.

Always capitalize anatomical descriptors such as “A1 Pulley,” “Extensor Tendon,” “Flexor Tendon,” “Palmar Surface,” “Thenar Eminence,” etc.

Do not lowercase these terms even if they appear mid-sentence.

Formatting Rules

Use concise, professional medical terminology.

Correct grammar, punctuation, and obvious transcription errors while preserving clinical meaning.

Findings should follow the format: Location + Body Part + Finding (e.g., “Moderate tenderness to palpation at the Left Index Finger A1 Pulley”).

If multiple body parts are listed, capitalize each (e.g., “Pain in the Wrist and Elbow”).

Only correct anatomy when it is clearly mis-transcribed.

Final Output

Output ONLY the completed JSON array.

Do not include explanations, reasoning, or additional text.

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: ... for Richard Kassab, K-A-S-S-A-B. We'll add that he underwent a right index finger trigger finger injection on 4-10-25, uh, which helped significantly. It started coming back 9/20/25.
Patient_1: Hey, Richard. It worked for a while.
Doctor_1: Uh, it did.
Patient_1: Yeah.
Nurse_1: Did it go back to normal or we're just still-
Patient_1: No. So it did go back to normal.
Nurse_1: Okay.
Patient_1: But any... Just, it tweaks or needs to then wait?
Doctor_1: Uh, no, no, we're all set. Uh, maybe we can give him the whole parent handout. Uh, just so you know what it looks like, we actually have a, a printout. All right, take care.
Nurse_1: Okay, thank you.
Doctor_1: Uh, let's see. Caring for the exam, uh, we'll say, um, minimal tenderness over A1 pulley of index finger. No active triggering, everything else normal. We can remove the imaging review and update his age to 44. Uh, we'll change the assessment to 44-year-old male with, uh, right index finger trigger finger. For the plan, uh, it does appear he had a trigger finger, as the injection did help him. Um, he has had some mild recurrence, but it is relatively mild at this time, so we elected to hold off on injection for now, but if it does worsen, he will let me know. We discussed topical and oral anti-inflammatories as needed.
Patient_1: For the practum, I see how he went, like, for us to-
