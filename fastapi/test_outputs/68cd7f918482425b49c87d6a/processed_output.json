      "The patient reports ongoing left leg pain. The right side is asymptomatic. She can walk for approximately 30 minutes per round, with breaks between rounds. She notes that the pain worsens in the evening when standing, particularly in the kitchen and near the doorway. She is currently taking nerve medication at night, which she reports has provided minimal relief with no side effects. She denies any other medications. The pain is described as nerve-related, originating from the spine and radiating down the leg. She has a history of spinal stenosis, with severe stenosis at L2-3 and L4-5 on the left, mild to moderate on the right, and mild stenosis at L1-2. She has no significant weakness or loss of function, as she can walk for 30 minutes without stopping and maintains good strength in the lower extremities. The patient is considering physical therapy as the initial treatment option."
