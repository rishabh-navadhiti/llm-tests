ROLE: You are an expert medical scribe.
TASK: Extract structured medical information from a doctor-patient conversation transcript and populate a provided JSON template.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

Output Format

You MUST output a JSON array of objects that exactly matches the structure, keys, and order of the provided template.

Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting.

Filling the Template

For each object in the template, fill the "content" field strictly based on the transcript, following the "instruction" for that field.

Use ONLY information explicitly stated in the transcript.

Handling Missing Data

If no relevant information is present in the transcript for a field, return the "default" value exactly as provided in the template.

Verbatim vs. Summarization

For fields requiring verbatim extraction, copy the doctor’s words exactly as dictated.

For fields requiring summarization, rewrite into a concise, professional clinical note.

Do not infer or assume information beyond what is clearly stated.

Capitalization Rules (MANDATORY)

Always capitalize the first letter of any body part, anatomical structure, or specific location.

Includes: Skin, Nail, Finger, Hand, Wrist, Forearm, Elbow, Shoulder, Clavicle, Chest, Abdomen, Hip, Thigh, Knee, Leg, Ankle, Foot, Toe, Neck, Back, Spine, Head, Face, Eye, Ear, Nose, Mouth, Tongue, Jaw, and all joint names.

Always capitalize anatomical descriptors such as “A1 Pulley,” “Extensor Tendon,” “Flexor Tendon,” “Palmar Surface,” “Thenar Eminence,” etc.

Do not lowercase these terms even if they appear mid-sentence.

Formatting Rules

Use concise, professional medical terminology.

Correct grammar, punctuation, and obvious transcription errors while preserving clinical meaning.

Findings should follow the format: Location + Body Part + Finding (e.g., “Moderate tenderness to palpation at the Left Index Finger A1 Pulley”).

If multiple body parts are listed, capitalize each (e.g., “Pain in the Wrist and Elbow”).

Only correct anatomy when it is clearly mis-transcribed.

Final Output

Output ONLY the completed JSON array.

Do not include explanations, reasoning, or additional text.

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: This is for Lindsay Cole, C-O-L-E. She is a 26-year-old right-hand dominant assistant at United Talent Agency who enjoys hiking and painting. Around 9-13-25, she noticed a mass on the top of her left wrist. She endorses prior issues with the wrist. She endorses discomfort and slight numbness. Typing or hyperflexion causes pain. She has tried Advil. Lindsay, hello! Nice to meet ya.
Patient: Oh my God.
Doctor_1: No, I play.
Patient: It's all right.
Doctor_1: All good, all good. Heard a little bit about ya.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: And this popped up out of the blue-
Patient: Yes.
Doctor_1: ... on Saturday, right?
Patient: Yeah, I noticed it on Saturday.
Doctor_1: Got it.
Patient: I have no idea why.
Doctor_1: But you've had some wrist pain-
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: ... uh, prior to that?
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: Was it with certain activities that you were having that wrist pain?
Patient: I have had wrist pain for a while. I do a lot of, like-
Doctor_1: Oh.
Patient: ... Pilates and yoga.
Doctor_1: Yeah. Yeah.
Patient: And I just whack my wrists a lot, and they're-
Doctor_1: Got it.
Patient: ... not the strongest.
Doctor_1: Good.
Patient: Um, and then I was, like, getting lunch with my friend and I was like, "Oh, my God. Is this a bum?"
Doctor_1: Okay.
Patient: And now it's this. Yeah.
Doctor_1: Got it. Um, has the pain gotten worse with the appearance of that? Or would you say the pain is kind of about the same?
Patient: It's not even wrist pain. It-
Doctor_1: Feels normal and the same on both sides here?
Patient: Mm-hmm.
Doctor_1: Normal same?
Patient: Mm-hmm.
Doctor_1: And normal same. Give me thumbs up. Keep your thumbs up. Don't let me push it down. Push it down. See, can't. Give me a okay sign like that. Don't let me open the circle. Good. Squeeze your fingers together like that. Don't let me pull your fingers apart. Keep that little finger next to the ring finger.
Patient: Okay. Fine.
Doctor_1: Uh, yeah. Sorry. How long you been at the agency?
Patient: Three years. That was weak.
Doctor_1: Got it. It's, it's a hard one. It's always... Patients always freak out. They're like, "Oh, my God. I have no strength." Um, it's normal. It's okay. I just want to make sure you have some strength there. Check the size of it here. All right, let's do an aspiration. I think five ccs of 1% should be plenty. Melissa, hello. At the end, we'll do a compression wrap and a, and a pop-out.
Nurse: Okay. Um, uh, place, uh, syringe to suction.
Doctor_1: Uh-
Nurse: 10 cc of 8 GL.
Doctor_1: Uh, caring for the patient, um, of her left upper extremity. Uh, skin intact. 17-by-16-millimeter raised rubbery mass over dorsal radial wrist where she is tender to palpation. Significant pain at terminal wrist flexion and extension. Negative scaphoid shift. Everything else normal. Um, for the assessment, 26-year-old female with left dorsal wrist ganglion cyst. Uh, we discussed her ganglion cyst at length and the various treatment options ranging from observation, to aspiration, to surgical excision. She elected to proceed with aspiration, uh, which was performed today. And she will continue with compression wrapping and a wrist brace for the next two weeks. She will let me know if there's any recurrence.
