ROLE: You are an expert medical scribe.
TASK: Extract structured medical information from a doctor-patient conversation transcript and populate a provided JSON template.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

Output Format

You MUST output a JSON array of objects that exactly matches the structure, keys, and order of the provided template.

Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting.

Filling the Template

For each object in the template, fill the "content" field strictly based on the transcript, following the "instruction" for that field.

Use ONLY information explicitly stated in the transcript.

Handling Missing Data

If no relevant information is present in the transcript for a field, return the "default" value exactly as provided in the template.

Verbatim vs. Summarization

For fields requiring verbatim extraction, copy the doctor’s words exactly as dictated.

For fields requiring summarization, rewrite into a concise, professional clinical note.

Do not infer or assume information beyond what is clearly stated.

Capitalization Rules (MANDATORY)

Always capitalize the first letter of any body part, anatomical structure, or specific location.

Includes: Skin, Nail, Finger, Hand, Wrist, Forearm, Elbow, Shoulder, Clavicle, Chest, Abdomen, Hip, Thigh, Knee, Leg, Ankle, Foot, Toe, Neck, Back, Spine, Head, Face, Eye, Ear, Nose, Mouth, Tongue, Jaw, and all joint names.

Always capitalize anatomical descriptors such as “A1 Pulley,” “Extensor Tendon,” “Flexor Tendon,” “Palmar Surface,” “Thenar Eminence,” etc.

Do not lowercase these terms even if they appear mid-sentence.

Formatting Rules

Use concise, professional medical terminology.

Correct grammar, punctuation, and obvious transcription errors while preserving clinical meaning.

Findings should follow the format: Location + Body Part + Finding (e.g., “Moderate tenderness to palpation at the Left Index Finger A1 Pulley”).

If multiple body parts are listed, capitalize each (e.g., “Pain in the Wrist and Elbow”).

Only correct anatomy when it is clearly mis-transcribed.

Final Output

Output ONLY the completed JSON array.

Do not include explanations, reasoning, or additional text.

### INSTRUCTIONS:
Extract information from the medical transcript below and populate the JSON template. Be precise and only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the transcript. Do not add any information that is not present in the transcript.

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: ... G-A-N. He is a 39-year-old right-hand dominant, accident attorney who enjoys working out. Uh... He reports paralysis of that left hand at the age of 17 due to a car accident, for which he underwent tendon transfer surgery with Dr. Culber, K-U-L-B-E-R, and at baseline has minimal use of hand. On 9-12-25, he was at a show and is unsure exactly what happened, but the hand may have been stepped on or he used it to break a ball. He underwent X-rays at urgent care, which demonstrated proximal phalanx fractures of the middle and index fingers on the left side.
Patient_1: Take it away, hey. I'm Eugene Sighs, nice to meet you.
Doctor_1: Left elbow X-ray, okay. Um... And for the exam, uh, we'll say skin intact, mild diffuse swelling throughout hand along with ecchymosis. No angulatory or rotational deformity, uh, of index or middle fingers. No significant active range of motion of middle or ind- index fingers. Um... And then we'll just leave it at that. We'll remove the, the sensation exam part and the, the motor exam, the OK sign and all that, we'll remove that. Um, and I'll dictate the elbow X-ray once we get it. Um, for the assessment, we'll say 39-year-old male with left index and middle finger proximal phalanx fractures. For the plan, we discussed his injury at length. The alignment currently looks good, so, uh, he will use his removable brace, uh, and avoid trauma to that hand, um, for the next five weeks. Uh, I will see him again in three weeks, uh, with repeat X-rays of the hand.

### OUTPUT:
Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the template structure above. Do not include any explanations, commentary, or additional text outside the JSON structure.
