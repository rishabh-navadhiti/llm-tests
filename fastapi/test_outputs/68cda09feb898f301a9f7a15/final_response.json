        "A 79-year-old right-hand dominant female presented with left wrist pain following a fall on 9-11-25 while playing on the floor with her dog. She lost her balance and fell onto her left hand, resulting in immediate onset of pain. She was evaluated in the emergency department, where X-rays confirmed a left distal radius fracture. She underwent reduction and splinting. She denies numbness or tingling. She has moderate to mild swelling and ecchymosis involving the left wrist, forearm, and fingers. She has radial shift with the radial shaft impacting the ulna, and the fracture is dorsally and radially translated. She is currently stable with a snug splint. She has been counseled on treatment options, including surgery, and elected to proceed despite risks such as blood loss, infection, nerve or vascular injury, tendon injury, and stiffness."
