ROLE: You are an expert medical scribe.
TASK: Extract structured medical information from a doctor-patient conversation transcript and populate a provided JSON template.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

Output Format

You MUST output a JSON array of objects that exactly matches the structure, keys, and order of the provided template.

Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting.

Filling the Template

For each object in the template, fill the "content" field strictly based on the transcript, following the "instruction" for that field.

Use ONLY information explicitly stated in the transcript.

Handling Missing Data

If no relevant information is present in the transcript for a field, return the "default" value exactly as provided in the template.

Verbatim vs. Summarization

For fields requiring verbatim extraction, copy the doctor’s words exactly as dictated.

For fields requiring summarization, rewrite into a concise, professional clinical note.

Do not infer or assume information beyond what is clearly stated.

Capitalization Rules (MANDATORY)

Always capitalize the first letter of any body part, anatomical structure, or specific location.

Includes: Skin, Nail, Finger, Hand, Wrist, Forearm, Elbow, Shoulder, Clavicle, Chest, Abdomen, Hip, Thigh, Knee, Leg, Ankle, Foot, Toe, Neck, Back, Spine, Head, Face, Eye, Ear, Nose, Mouth, Tongue, Jaw, and all joint names.

Always capitalize anatomical descriptors such as “A1 Pulley,” “Extensor Tendon,” “Flexor Tendon,” “Palmar Surface,” “Thenar Eminence,” etc.

Do not lowercase these terms even if they appear mid-sentence.

Formatting Rules

Use concise, professional medical terminology.

Correct grammar, punctuation, and obvious transcription errors while preserving clinical meaning.

Findings should follow the format: Location + Body Part + Finding (e.g., “Moderate tenderness to palpation at the Left Index Finger A1 Pulley”).

If multiple body parts are listed, capitalize each (e.g., “Pain in the Wrist and Elbow”).

Only correct anatomy when it is clearly mis-transcribed.

Final Output

Output ONLY the completed JSON array.

Do not include explanations, reasoning, or additional text.

### INSTRUCTIONS:
Extract information from the medical transcript below and populate the JSON template. Be precise and only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the transcript. Do not add any information that is not present in the transcript.

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: ... patient visit for Sahum Farahan, F-A-R-A-H-A-N. She is a 79-year-old right-hand dominant female, retired homemaker, who enjoys cooking and reading. Uh, on 9-11-25, she lost her balance playing on the floor with her dog, uh, and she fell onto and ostracized left hand with Q onset of left wrist pain. She presented to the ED where she underwent X-rays, which demonstrated a left distal radius fracture, and she underwent a reduction and splinting. She denies numbness or tingling.
Nurse_1: So I would wrap this up here.
Patient_1: Yeah.
Nurse_1: You got a lock from the way you had it.
Patient_1: Yeah, I did. All right.
Nurse_1: Yeah, you're welcome.
Patient_1: Appreciate it. Does that look, that look okay? I don't remember.
Doctor_1: Yeah, I think that's right.
Patient_1: It was like-
Doctor_1: As long as it feels snug-
Patient_1: There.
Doctor_1: ... stable and snug on there, uh, it should be fine. You can play around with this, perhaps, uh, whichever works.
Nurse_1: See you in three weeks.
Doctor_1: Um, moderate to few swelling and ecchymosis throughout wrist and forearm and fingers. This is for the left side. Um, everything else normal for the assessment. 79-year-old female with left distal radius fracture. For the plan, uh, we discussed her fracture at length and the various treatment options. Uh, she does have quite a bit of radial shift with the radial shaft impacting the ulna, and I worry that this may cause her issues. We did- we discussed the risks of surgery, including but not limited to, blood loss, infection, nerve vas injury, tendon injury, and stiffness, and she elected to proceed. Did I dictate the X-ray?
Scribe_1: Uh, yeah, yeah, doctor. Uh, the X-rays we have them in the ED, not the one-
Doctor_1: Oh, okay. The one today? Okay, yeah, I'll dictate the one for today, he issued. Actually it's the left wrist, showing a, uh, radially translated as well as dorsally translated d- distal radial- distal radius fracture. Um, um, no severe degenerative changes.
Nurse_1: This is the metacarpal fracture.
Doctor_1: Oh, okay.
Patient_1: Looks good.
Doctor_1: Yeah, yeah.
