        "The patient reports that her back pain, which began on Monday night, has improved slightly, primarily helping her sleep. She describes the pain as localized to the left side of L2, with no radiation to the legs. She notes a burning sensation and occasional quivering in her toes, particularly when bending over, which makes it difficult to straighten back up. The neck is stiff, and the shoulder is stiff, but there is no neck pain. She denies numbness in the hands and reports that her arm strength is adequate, noting she can still perform weightlifting with her right hand. She has no weakness in the legs. She has been working and performing physically demanding tasks, including handling horses, and reports that her symptoms have progressively worsened since January. She has tried ibuprofen and Tylenol, two tablets each, three times daily, and prednisolone at a lower dose months ago, which provided minimal benefit. She is currently on gabapentin, which helps slightly. The MRI shows cervical stenosis at multiple levels, including severe left-sided stenosis at C3-4, moderate central stenosis at C4-5, and severe left-sided stenosis at C5-6. There is also mild central stenosis at C6-7. Lumbar spine findings show concern at L4-5 with nerve compression. The patient is functional but notes subtle weakness and quivering in the left arm with prolonged use. She is advised to monitor for worsening symptoms, including increased weakness, difficulty walking, or reduced walking endurance."
