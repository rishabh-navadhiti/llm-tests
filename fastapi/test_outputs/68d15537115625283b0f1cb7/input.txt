As a seasoned medical scribe specializing in the SOAP template, your task is to transform the transcription of the doctor-patient conversation into a structured patient visit note. This note must adhere to the doctor's preferred format, ensuring that all crucial details are captured without the doctor needing to personally document them. Your expertise lies in understanding medical terminology and effectively conveying information in a professional tone. Each section of the patient visit note, such as History of Present Illness and Past Medical History, corresponds to a specific object in the JSON template provided by the doctor. If specific information is absent from the conversation, you will incorporate the default value specified in each template section. Ensure that the final output is formatted as a JSON array of objects, maintaining the same exact order and format as the given doctorâ€™s preferred template. Be meticulous in avoiding any grammatical errors and ensure all sentences are correctly punctuated. This will allow for seamless integration for further processing, such as parsing into an array of objects using Python programming language. Please recheck the sentence and correct any grammatical errors in the following medical-related template. Ensure clarity, professionalism, and proper medical terminology while maintaining a concise and structured format

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: Rupa. Okay, we're going to see Benjamin Posey. She's on Spencer's schedule at 8:45, okay? Good.
Family_member_1: Good morning.
Doctor_1: Morning. How are you? I'm doing well. How are you?
Family_member_1: You're getting in one of our good days.
Doctor_1: Yeah, I was gonna say .
Family_member_1: Yeah. Thank you very much.
Doctor_1: Hi. Of course. How are you? How are things?
Family_member_1: Doing okay. Okay.
Doctor_1: Your cat got your tongue? You don't wanna talk?
Family_member_1: Going good. So-
Doctor_1: It's okay, you can say hi.
Family_member_1: Can you say good morning? Good morning.
Doctor_1: Mm.
Family_member_1: Are you a little shy? Are you a little shy? No. Yeah. Okay . You wanna show me your finger to the doctor?
Doctor_1: What's on your shirt? Tell me about your shirt.
Family_member_1: I like horses.
Doctor_1: You like forests?
Family_member_1: He wants to be an artist when he grows up.
Doctor_1: Oh, that's cool. So which do you like better, the bear or the... Is that an elk or a deer?
Family_member_1: The bear.
Doctor_1: The deer, okay. You like the deer better? Not the bear? Do bears scare you? No? They scare me.
Family_member_1: I think that's the reason.
Doctor_1: No, the picture of a bear. That's fair.
Family_member_1: He's gotta be strong. He has eight brothers, so he's gotta go beat them up .
Doctor_1: How, where are you in the lineup?
Family_member_1: I'm high up.
Doctor_1: Oh. Do your older brothers pick on you?
Family_member_1: They did. No, he doesn't stand for it.
Doctor_1: Yeah? You fight back? What about your younger brothers, are you mean to your little brothers?
Family_member_1: He sounds like an anime, you know? I, I appreciate that.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Family_member_1: Wait, so if you're like mean to your little brothers, then how come you're too afraid to talk to me?
Doctor_1: You're a tough guy, right? No?
Family_member_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: You're a nice guy?
Family_member_1: He's a very nice guy.
Doctor_1: You take good care of them, right?
Family_member_1: Mm-hmm.
Doctor_1: As long as they understand that you're, you know, bigger, stronger, faster-
Family_member_1: They gotta listen .
Doctor_1: ... they gotta listen, right?
Family_member_1: Trying to minimize the fact that we don't want there to be trauma for ever going rollerblading again after this .
Doctor_1: Oh, no. Come on, you gotta go rollerblading. It's so much fun. How does it feel? How much pain are you having right now?
Family_member_1: Here, right now I'm feeling a lot of pain? Um-
Doctor_1: Can you make a fist for me? Okay, good. Open all the way.
Family_member_1: He was saying that like right after you took it off, there's a little less range of motion and he feels like there's more range of motion even 10 minutes later.
Doctor_1: Yeah. That's the magic of being young.
Family_member_1: Exactly.
Doctor_1: If it was you or me we'd be like, "Move," he'd be like... And that's the way that it is.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Okay, so let's see.
Family_member_1: What color was your first cast? Blue. And now you got a red one?
Doctor_1: Any pain when I push? Good. And no pain up here, right? No pain when I go like this. A little stretching.
Family_member_1: What?
Doctor_1: A little stretching.
Family_member_1: Feel like it's stretching?
Doctor_1: No. Good. Um, let me show you...
Family_member_1: It's your fingers. Believe it .
Doctor_1: So, we look at... Sort of like, I think, you know, the... You can kind of see it's like right along here, it's just a little bit of a buckle fracture.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: This is where he's growing from.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: We protected it 'cause it's near the, where he's growing from.
Family_member_1: Sure.
Doctor_1: But if you look at how it's going, and you look at even how, you know, how he's healing, you can see that it's actually already smoothing out here.
Family_member_1: Great.
Doctor_1: And you can see the extra bone as he's remodeling it.
Family_member_1: Wow.
Doctor_1: It does go- it does go all the way across here, but, um, everything looks nice and stable. The physis looks wonderful.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: He's not tender on palpation. I, I look at this and I go, I think we can transition him to some buddy straps or something-
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: ... to sort of give him a little bit of protection, but not too much.
Family_member_1: So just like bare tape?
Doctor_1: Yeah, just some tape.
Family_member_1: And for how long?
Doctor_1: Couple weeks.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Now obviously, any time that you come out of a cast and you have a fracture, there's always a risk of refracture.
Family_member_1: Right.
Doctor_1: So, 'cause it just doesn't move naturally, but you can see he's already moving better. Um, so I would just be mindful and watchful of it.
Family_member_1: Right.
Doctor_1: But you, I mean, probably won't be able to slow him down all that much.
Family_member_1: Exactly, and writing and all of that.
Doctor_1: Yeah. Do his, do your thing.
Family_member_1: Do, just do regular life.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Sound good?
Family_member_1: Sound good, buddy? Yeah. Showering? No, no, we just wanna put tape. You can shower, you can do everything regular now. Oh.
Doctor_1: Yeah, the only-
Family_member_1: How about softball?
Doctor_1: The only thing I would probably avoid for the next two weeks would be like tetherball, basketball, rollerskating-
Family_member_1: Yeah, softball. That one. Hm?
Family_member_1: ... even his tetherball, okay? So we're good .
Doctor_1: I love-
Family_member_1: I know. I love him so much.
Doctor_1: You know what tetherball is?
Family_member_1: It's got to be a big hole-
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Family_member_1: ... with this thing, and you hit it, and then you've got to catch it-
Doctor_1: They probably, they probably took those out. They're probably-
Family_member_1: Yeah, they have it at our, on our book. Yep.
Doctor_1: Okay.
Family_member_1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's probably, it's probably, probably starts too many fights with that . Uh, so things that are involving direct, heavy-
Doctor_1: Just, just sort of like, you know-
Family_member_1: ... contact. Right.
Doctor_1: ... big, heavy balls, probably not the best right now.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: But maybe just a couple weeks. They, they actually look fantastic, so I'm not even-
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: If I were worried about it, I'd put him back in a cast. I, I'm not worried about it. I just, you know, wanna minimize you having to come back.
Family_member_1: Sure .
Doctor_1: And then the only other thing that I would do is I'd say come back in, like four to six weeks.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Um, probably one, one last X-ray just to make sure that-
Family_member_1: Great.
Doctor_1: ... you've sort of gotten outside of the injury window.
Family_member_1: Sure. We'll see
Doctor_1: We can verify that the, that the physis is in fact doing what it's supposed to-
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: ... with growing. Keep on growing.
Family_member_1: Good job. Do we have any sense from these type of things, or it's, it would be a different X-ray about, like his overall growth rate, and how tall, and how... that's kind of stuff or-
Doctor_1: Uh, you can-
Family_member_1: ... age appropriate?
Doctor_1: You can, on hand X-rays, which, you know, again, when you look at, when you, when you look at this, these are finger X-rays, not hand X-rays.
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: On hand X-rays, you can, um, there are ways to determine bone age, um, but even that, we can, you know, we can't look at just a single finger X-ray.
Family_member_1: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Doctor_1: Um, are you concerned about that?
Family_member_1: With some of other kids, so that's one of the things-
Doctor_1: Um, I'd, I, you know, there... The pediatric orthopedic surgeons usually do more of those. They, they tend to do that. And then there's also, if there's concern about hormone imbalances and things like that-
Family_member_1: Right.
Doctor_1: ... there are pediatric endocrinologists.
Family_member_1: Thanks for that. Yeah.
Doctor_1: Unfortunately, I just do the book. The fixing.
Family_member_1: Yes .
Doctor_1: I do the fixing.
Family_member_1: Right. No, but I think, yeah, I don't think any particular concern, you know, that could be-
Doctor_1: I don't see-
Family_member_1: ... only six feet-
Doctor_1: I don't... Well, I- Um, you know, good health, good, good protein intake, all that good stuff.
Family_member_1: Yeah, and genes.
Doctor_1: Yeah, and gene. These are the most important. But when we look at this, it looks okay.
Family_member_1: Okay, perfect. Really, really appreciate it.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Family_member_1: Thank you so much. You said big thank you. Yeah. Give me a handshake. We appreciate it so much, guys.
Doctor_1: Look at that. He's like, "Bone, bone, bone." Hold on, I'll get you those, those buddy tapes, okay?
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Family_member_1: Please. You print it, Dr. Gutita?
Doctor_1: You're good. No, uh, you're good. Okay, so, uh, finger fracture, um, we're gonna transition to buddy straps, so if you just get him a pair of buddy straps. Actually, just get him, like... Just put one right here. It's perfect.
Family_member_1: Okay. Just one? Okay.
Doctor_1: Yeah, just one, 'cause this fracture's down here, so-
Family_member_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Just, so buddy strap, um, and then follow-up in four to six weeks. Uh, he, so, uh, HPI, he's doing better. Um, his pain is doing better. He's really tired of the cast. Uh, on physical exam, uh, there's no soft tissue swelling. There's no tenderness palpatation at the index finger, proximal phalanx. His rotation appears appropriate, and he is able to make a fist. Um, neurovasculature tact distally, X-rays.
