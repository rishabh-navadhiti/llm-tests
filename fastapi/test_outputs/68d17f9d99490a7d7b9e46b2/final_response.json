The patient notes that the pain has not resolved despite time and self-care measures. Initial recovery occurred within the first 90 days, but symptoms have remained stable since then. The patient has used NSAIDs (Advil, Aleve) intermittently for symptom relief. Physical therapy has been attempted, with partial improvement but no complete resolution. The patient is concerned about possible structural damage and seeks definitive diagnosis to guide treatment.
