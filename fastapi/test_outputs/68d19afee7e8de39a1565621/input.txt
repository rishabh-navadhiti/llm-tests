As a seasoned medical scribe specializing in the SOAP template, your task is to transform the transcription of the doctor-patient conversation into a structured patient visit note. This note must adhere to the doctor's preferred format, ensuring that all crucial details are captured without the doctor needing to personally document them. Your expertise lies in understanding medical terminology and effectively conveying information in a professional tone. Each section of the patient visit note, such as History of Present Illness and Past Medical History, corresponds to a specific object in the JSON template provided by the doctor. If specific information is absent from the conversation, you will incorporate the default value specified in each template section. Ensure that the final output is formatted as a JSON array of objects, maintaining the same exact order and format as the given doctor’s preferred template. Be meticulous in avoiding any grammatical errors and ensure all sentences are correctly punctuated. This will allow for seamless integration for further processing, such as parsing into an array of objects using Python programming language. Please recheck the sentence and correct any grammatical errors in the following medical-related template. Ensure clarity, professionalism, and proper medical terminology while maintaining a concise and structured format

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: Who's coming? I think she's coming.
Patient_1: Yeah. Is that the knee surgery she did? That's the-
Doctor_1: Yeah, well, it's all recorded, yeah.
Patient_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: I did too yesterday. I did a hip- hi. I did a hip and two knees yesterday, so-
Patient_1: Mm-hmm.
Doctor_1: Luckily for me, there's a lot of arthritis out there.
Patient_1: Is that what it is then?
Doctor_1: Oh, yeah. Thank you. All right. Let me clean this up. Yeah. Looks good. All right. Let's take a peek here. We'll take all this. So you guys did good. Is it doing okay?
Patient_1: It's okay.
Doctor_1: Good. Yeah, that's really good. Awesome. All right. We're gonna get all this stuff out today. So we'll get the sutures and the staples out. Let me see it straighten out all the way. Really good. All right. So probably about five degrees there. Let's see you bring it back all the way. Really good. So that's about 100. So I like where we are. Is therapy coming? They're working with you? Okay. Good. All right. I'm happy with this. This looks good. So, you know, we're looking good from an x-ray.
Patient_1: Can you see the difference?
Doctor_1: In the back? Yeah. That'll move around, so that's now-
Patient_1: Oh, okay.
Doctor_1: ... and then it'll be here and then it'll be here.
Patient_1: Oh, okay.
Doctor_1: So, because we're really... What are we? Two weeks plus?
Patient_1: Three weeks.
Doctor_1: Three weeks now. Yeah. So, you know, you're through the worst of it, but it's gonna continue to get better.
Patient_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: I just wanted to check because of the little wound thing that was still there.
Patient_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: So we'll get all that out today. Continue physical therapy. They're still coming, right?
Patient_1: Yes.
Doctor_1: Okay. And then I want to see you in a month.
Patient_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Are you okay on medication and everything?
Patient_1: Mm-hmm. Yes.
Doctor_1: All right.
Patient_1: And then, uh, is there anything we have to do to clean it out?
Doctor_1: No. At this point, no. Just leave it open to air. Let's see what-
Patient_1: Need a bandage or no?
Doctor_1: It's not draining or anything, so you're fine.
Patient_1: Yeah. And but still keep covering in the shower?
Doctor_1: Yeah. For the next couple weeks I would, and then after that, if it looks good, then it just... Then you don't have to. Just because we're going to take the staples and sutures out today. All right. Any questions?
Patient_1: No. We're good. Okay.
Doctor_1: Yeah. Good. All right. Uh, have my nurse take the staples out. I can't stand the sound of screaming. No, I'm just kidding. All right.
Patient_1: Thank you.
Doctor_1: Hang on a sec. We'll bring her in. So Miss Concepcion has staples and sutures to take out. Remember, that was the one we did the wound vac on.
