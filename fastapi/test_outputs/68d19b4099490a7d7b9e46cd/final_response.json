She describes her condition as manageable but notes that the pain has become increasingly severe, significantly impacting her quality of life. The pain is primarily localized to the hip, groin, and thigh, occasionally radiating to the knee and shin. She denies any numbness or sensory changes in the lower extremities. The patient states that the pain has been present for many years and has progressively worsened, affecting her ability to perform daily activities such as bathing in a traditional Japanese style, which requires kneeling. She reports using ibuprofen and Tylenol for pain relief, but these have provided only minimal improvement. The patient expresses significant anxiety about the upcoming surgery, citing concerns about anesthesia, low sodium levels (132), and the possibility of complications such as bleeding, infection, blood clots, fractures, dislocation, and temporary numbness in the lateral thigh due to nerve involvement. She is also concerned about postoperative pain management and the potential for constipation from pain medications. Despite these concerns, she acknowledges that the surgery is necessary due to the impact on her daily functioning and overall well-being."
