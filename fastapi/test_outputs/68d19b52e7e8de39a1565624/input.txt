As a seasoned medical scribe specializing in the SOAP template, your task is to transform the transcription of the doctor-patient conversation into a structured patient visit note. This note must adhere to the doctor's preferred format, ensuring that all crucial details are captured without the doctor needing to personally document them. Your expertise lies in understanding medical terminology and effectively conveying information in a professional tone. Each section of the patient visit note, such as History of Present Illness and Past Medical History, corresponds to a specific object in the JSON template provided by the doctor. If specific information is absent from the conversation, you will incorporate the default value specified in each template section. Ensure that the final output is formatted as a JSON array of objects, maintaining the same exact order and format as the given doctor’s preferred template. Be meticulous in avoiding any grammatical errors and ensure all sentences are correctly punctuated. This will allow for seamless integration for further processing, such as parsing into an array of objects using Python programming language. Please recheck the sentence and correct any grammatical errors in the following medical-related template. Ensure clarity, professionalism, and proper medical terminology while maintaining a concise and structured format

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: Hello , nice to see you . All right , so I guess this is our yearly thing , but then kind of had some symptoms a month ago , is that ?
Patient: sound like it .
Doctor_1: wait , no , it does sound
Patient: it . I , you know , we got a new roof , and then I was just doing 11 thing went to another , and then I entertained . And then I am 65 . I guess I just , and then I tried to do , um , you know , the PT exercises from years ago when I found it 6 years ago . But um there's some , I , I just have gotten so weak .
Doctor_1: do you feel the , if you feel , well , what's happening now ? she said , I
Patient: feel pain , but let me just show you . I can't
Doctor_1: it's that sort of , yeah , I have that lurch .
Patient: can't put weights . So then I , I go quickly to my strongship .
Doctor_1: , so they in the left . Well , I don't , um , it looks , it looks unchanged from last year , which is kind of what we're about . Let me show you the split screen here . So the , the things we're looking at here , those are about the same . May may blow up the right head , that's what we care about . The left looks good .
Patient: always good to hear . It feels
Doctor_1: . So , um , this was a year ago . This is today . And so one of the things we're like , we're just kind of looking at the cup here . And so you see these little cysts in here . Now those don't really look changed to me . The cup position doesn't look changed . If you notice there's some eccentricity where the ball sits in the cup , like it's not in the middle , and that's been a function of the wear and tear over time . But you can't see what's in there is a piece of plastic . So the plastic over time wears and obviously it's gonna wear on the top where you your weight . So so
Patient: saying means that this doesn't have as much distance as that .
Doctor_1: when you started , you did , and then as that thing has worn . So look , this was put in when in '99 or how long ago ? Yeah , so I mean it's , it's actually held up quite well and then the big question is , you know , so a lot of your business now , I don't necessarily because I . I'm not seeing any massive changes , but it may be this muscle here more than anything that's the abductor muscle and that causes that little lurch that you're getting ,
Patient: I can I can I think that's the next step here . But look , at some point , if
Doctor_1: continues to be an issue , etc . then you know the question is , are we looking at a revision right where we have to . You know , maybe not change everything up , but change the cup out or something like that . I , I'd probably send you to , there's a guy at SC that does more complicated things . I might send you to him if it comes to that , but I don't think we're at that point yet . Again , if I see some massive changes , then that's a different story . That's why we're checking this every year , right ? Just make sure there's no changes . So anyway , cause you know , these things don't last
Patient: forever is a long time . 43 years . It happens . Um , um , I just , the , the , when I look at both sides of it , like if I wait , will I be weaker to recuperate if I wait till I'm 75 ?
Doctor_1: know , it's a , it's a , I get this all the time , right ? Not , not just about revisions , but just in doing the joint replacements like , Well , I'm healthy now . Uh , do I , I mean , look , one thing I can give you this guy's info if you wanted to , cause what the , what they would probably do is Uh , they would talk about what it would look like with an operation , but then also , would there be a little bit of a workup , but sometimes they'll say , well , let's get a bone scan , see if it truly is loose or whatever . I mean , whether they would do that or not . They might , they might do that . But , uh , I'll give you info , but ,
Patient: know ,
Doctor_1: not it's
Patient: urgent . Yeah , no , I know you're not . Well , this is
Doctor_1: that's the question . The , the big question is , um . If anything looks like it's got a little date to it , it's the right , because we know the plastic is the thing that wears out . So one thing could be done because you want to do as little as you need to do . So a total revision would be everything comes out , new stuff goes in . It's a lot easier to revise just the cup and then this ball can be knocked off and a new ball put on . That's easy it's modular , and then , and then then a new cup put in there . That's a lot easier than having to take this sucker out because that thing's in there .
Patient: , you
Doctor_1: to , in terms of the femur , not necessarily . That actually looks nice and solid , so no , I mean , but , but again , and then the , the most basic revision . Would be you go in there , you leave the cup , you leave the stem , the plastic can be removed . It's modular . You put in a new , it's like , you know , a new tire , right ? You put in a new plastic and now this thing is back to where it's supposed to live and the new plastics are even better , that'll probably take you throughout the rest of your life . I'm just concerned because again , you know , when the plastic wears out , you get little particles and sometimes that can cause losing . So that would be the question is the most , if we're talking surgery , the most minimum would be . What we call head and liner change and that's and
Patient: 
Doctor_1: still send , I'm probably still sending him to do .
Patient: ,
Doctor_1: complexity . Uh , and then that would be the simplest , and then the next step would be to just do the cut part , leave the stem , and then the biggest one would be taking everything out .
Patient: , well , I think if I , right now , I'm thinking , I do tai chi . I walk every day . If I , if I get the physical therapy , if you can prescribe
Doctor_1: that for sure .
Patient: see if that does the trick .
Doctor_1: , I think so . Let me , let me write it for you . Let me see you in a couple of months . And let's , let's see where we are , um , and we'll just , you know , again , hopefully this is just a little blip and .
Patient: I know I , you know , then when it hurt , it hurts , and then , you know , use it , it atrophies , sneaker , and then I , like I try to water a week later and then I get my foot just slipped slightly . And I felt it move . And then , and then , so then I waited another week , but now it's getting tough and stuff .
Doctor_1: have a therapist you like ?
Patient: , I like , um , I don't know if he's still there , Dean with Vincent . She's
Doctor_1: 
Patient: 
Doctor_1: . Yeah , Dean moves on . I like Dean too . I'll give you the list . You know he might have moved out of the area , but I don't , I don't know that for sure . Um ,
Patient: my friend likes to , uh , she said , I think she's gonna be in this
Doctor_1: downstairs . Yeah , they're good . They're not on the list , but they're good .
Patient: . Do you need to prescribe them or do
Doctor_1: ? No , that , that's , this is for anybody . So if you have , you just get their info so I make an appointment , then they'll do that . And then you give them
Patient: . Yeah ,
Doctor_1: that's nice and convenient . So , OK ,
Patient: I will . OK .
Doctor_1: right , sounds like a plan .
Patient: , yeah ,
Doctor_1: don't see any change on the
Patient: . And New York City or ? Yeah , nice . So I , I um getting married . So I wanna be able to walk if it's not freezing cold and , you know , really not be like this .
Doctor_1: they walk in Manhattan ?
Patient: don't know .
Doctor_1: both my kids are there , so yeah , one's in Lower East Side , one in Brooklyn ,
Patient: . Yeah .
