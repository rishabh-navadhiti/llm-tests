      "The patient is a 65-year-old individual who reports progressive weakness and pain in the left hip over the past month. The symptoms began after performing household tasks related to a new roof installation, including lifting and moving objects. The patient describes difficulty bearing weight on the left leg and a sensation of instability or 'lurch' when walking. They report attempting physical therapy exercises from six years ago but have noticed worsening weakness despite these efforts. The patient notes that the pain is persistent and has led to decreased mobility, with a recent episode of feeling the hip 'move' and a subsequent decline in strength. The patient is concerned about the long-term implications of delaying intervention, particularly given their desire to remain active and walk comfortably in New York City, including for social events such as their upcoming wedding. They express concern about potential muscle atrophy due to disuse and are seeking guidance on whether to pursue surgical revision or continue with conservative management."
