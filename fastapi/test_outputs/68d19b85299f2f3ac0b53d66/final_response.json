        "The patient is a 65-year-old female presenting with ongoing knee pain, swelling, and warmth, particularly on the lateral aspect of the right knee. She reports that the knee has been increasingly painful and hot, describing a sensation of it feeling like it might boil. The pain is exacerbated by bending the knee at the level of the bed, especially when lying on her left side. She notes that the popliteus area is tender and that she has difficulty with knee extension, although her range of motion has improved since her recent knee replacement. She reports that physical therapy has been delayed due to lack of prescription, but she is scheduled to begin PT on Thursday. She also inquired about the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures, expressing concern after learning about the recommendation two days prior. She was advised that prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for two years post-knee replacement due to the risk of bacterial seeding from oral flora leading to prosthetic joint infection. She is currently not taking any antibiotics and is awaiting a prescription for cephalexin for dental prophylaxis. She denies any recent trauma or infection but is concerned about the potential for infection related to her prosthetic knee."
