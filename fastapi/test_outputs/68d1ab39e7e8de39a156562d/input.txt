As a seasoned medical scribe specializing in the SOAP template, your task is to transform the transcription of the doctor-patient conversation into a structured brief patient visit note. This note must adhere to the doctor's preferred format, ensuring that all crucial details are captured without the doctor needing to personally document them. Your expertise lies in understanding medical terminology and effectively conveying information in a professional tone. Each section of the patient visit note, such as History of Present Illness and Past Medical History, corresponds to a specific object in the JSON template provided by the doctor. If specific information is absent from the conversation, you will incorporate the default value specified in each template section. Ensure that the final output is formatted as a JSON array of objects, maintaining the same exact order and format as the given doctor’s preferred template. Be meticulous in avoiding any grammatical errors and ensure all sentences are correctly punctuated. This will allow for seamless integration for further processing, such as parsing into an array of objects using Python programming language. Please recheck the sentence and correct any grammatical errors in the following medical-related template. Ensure clarity, professionalism, and proper medical terminology while maintaining a concise and structured format. Make sure the note is very brief and not too detailed will ensure all information is captured.

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Patient: আপনি আমারে প্যাকেট। আমি �আপনারে আপনার। বাবা। বোন। ছেলে। মেয়ে। ছেলে। মেয়ে। বোন।
Doctor: All right. Let's see, Carol Farrell. X-ray show right full hip implant in good position. Hello. How are you?
Patient: Good. How are you?
Doctor: Good. Haven't seen you-
Patient: Yeah. I live in Sierra Madre, so-
Doctor: E- Everything okay? What's happened?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I was glowed ... Well, I did have to ... We were all, all had to evacuate.
Doctor: Yeah, sure.
Patient: And but, um, I was able to move, and my power was out for a long time, so-
Doctor: Is it, are you back up?
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: Yeah. I'm up, I'm up above Eaton Canyon Golf Course, so we're, we're fine.
Patient: In the glen?
Doctor: Near there.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: Yeah, near there. Uh, all that was fine. Like, we had this weird-
Patient: I can't believe the glen did that area because ... Yeah. It, it was-
Doctor: Super weird. Like, it was this weird, like, buffer zone. Uh, power's out, no gat- I mean, we're still, uh-
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: I guess, I don't know if we're technically in the ... They, they let us back up to the house, so we could at least go up there and clean things up and whatever, but-
Patient: Oh, so you, you still don't have power?
Doctor: As of yesterday, we didn't. Yeah, or gas. They shut, they individually shut off all the gas.
Patient: I knew because there was, I guess, some damage to gas lines, uh-
Doctor: Yeah. And they were digging, uh ... Oh, you know what? That's interesting 'cause they were digging a big hole at the bottom of the hill. I wonder if that-
Patient: It's probably-
Doctor: Probably that. Yeah. There you go. Okay. So, that makes some sense. Um, all right. What's going on with you?
Patient: Well-
Doctor: This is now-
Patient: Uh, yeah. We was-
Doctor: ... almost 10 years old.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: It's January.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: Actually, it is 10 years ago. January, it was January of, uh-
Patient: Oh.
Doctor: ... 2015. Almost exactly 10 years. Yeah.
Patient: Um, so the hip works great. I have no problem with that. The problem I have, and I think I came in a couple years ago about this-
Doctor: Yeah.
Patient: ... is the hip-
Doctor: The hip flexor.
Patient: ... the hip flexor.
Doctor: Yeah.
Patient: And I'm, I'm not 100% sure that's what it is 'cause I have, I hired a trainer. I've been seeing a trainer for a year and a half, and we work on that all the time.
Doctor: Yeah.
Patient: It never gets better.
Doctor: Is it hard to, like, get in the car and that kind of thing?
Patient: Absolutely.
Doctor: It's like this, this and this.
Patient: I can't do this.
Doctor: Yeah.
Patient: I mean, I can, I can do it, but I have to li- I have to do this to get it up.
Doctor: Yeah. Right. That's right. So, I mean, the implant looks fine. Here, this is you today. Uh-
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: So, I mean, there's no ... It's not loose. There's no ... The me- the metal looks fine. You know, this is something we see from time to time, and I don't know if it's, like, a chronic tendonitis. I don't know. Th- This is a com- Not, not common, but we see it sometimes.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: Can, can you flex up like that?
Patient: I can't.
Doctor: It's hard to do.
Patient: It's hard to do, and it hurts.
Doctor: Do you have any numbness, tingling, or is it just that pain and function?
Patient: Just the pain.
Doctor: Okay. And that, that doesn't bother you if I do it?
Patient: Nope.
Doctor: Yeah. It's, it's the difference. The muscle. So, look. Um, we're surgeons, right? So, we always talk about surgery.
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Doctor: So, I don't, I don't think there's a lot of th- so, what are we talking about? Is there something to be gained to rip everything out and put something back in? I don't think so. I mean, that's a long run, and there's no-
Patient: I just mainly wanted to make sure there was nothing going on.
Doctor: And then, and then ... And the fact fact is, it looks great. So, I'm, I'm not worried about the metal. This is the cr- This is that tendonitis. Are you doing everything right? Yes, you are. Um.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: The one thing you could try, if you haven't already, I know you've seen Myers in the past.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: Is that he can do some things, like injections, try to inject the, the, the tendon. See if he can get that pain to-
Patient: Or, like, the PRP?
Doctor: Un- Anything's on the table.
Patient: I did it on my back, and it helped like crazy.
Doctor: So, I think maybe what you should do is, is set up ... You, uh, you're already in with him, right? Or no?
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: So, just mention it to him.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: And see what he has-
Patient: Add that to the list.
Doctor: See, he'll, he'll give you all kinds of crazy options. I mean, what you decide to do is also up to you.
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Doctor: 'Cause-
Patient: It's just a bummer that insurance doesn't cover most of it, you know?
Doctor: The PRP it doesn't.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: But no, like, cortisone and other things-
Patient: Sure.
Doctor: ... are, are out there.
Patient: Sure.
Doctor: But I ... From a, from a just a hardware metal, I, I, I wouldn't-
Patient: It's all good.
Doctor: I wouldn't do anything. Yeah.
Patient: Yeah. Yeah. I remember the one thing you said before I had it, uh, the replacement. You said, "Can you bend over and tie your shoe?" And I said, "No, I can't." So, it's not quite like that, but-
Doctor: Well, it, it's ... The arthritis is gone, so that, that business is better.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: But this is a functional muscle tendon thing.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Right? That's why, like, if you're sitting here, it's okay.
Patient: If-
Doctor: As soon as you do this, then that's it.
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: Yeah.
Patient: Yeah. Getting in the car is awf-
Doctor: That's-
Patient: I am a heavy feet-
Doctor: That's, that's a classic.
Patient: ... so I'm a lot higher.
Doctor: That's a classic coming up.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Yeah.
Patient: All right.
Doctor: So, but I think from my standpoint, you're fine. Just the metal looks good. There's nothing concerning.
Patient: Good, good. Good. That was my main concern.
Doctor: All right.
Patient: So, that's a good idea. I'll, uh, I'll, uh-
Doctor: Che- Check, check with the magic man.
Patient: Ask if I can see him.
Doctor: You'll see, huh?
Patient: About a new thing.
Doctor: Oh, I love it. All right. Nice to see you.
Patient: Bye. Take care.
Doctor: Yep. Do you have that report?
Patient: I do.
Doctor: I, I saw it somewhere.
Patient: It's in there. Do you want me to print it for you?
Doctor: What was it in? It wasn't Hill, though, was it?
Patient: No, it was at Wessing.
Doctor: It was done at the hospital. Why isn't it ... I didn't see it.
Patient: Hold up. I'm looking. It must be in your document.
Doctor: Oh, it's in there. Okay. Right groin. Her exam, she's got four out of five strength and, um, and hip flexion. I'll take a look at it. What the fuck is this?
Patient: This, she wanted some labs from your primary order.
Doctor: Yeah.
Patient: And like, the primary-
