        "The patient reports a history of left knee injury in April, followed by right shoulder pain. Subsequently, pelvic bone pain developed, described as a 'locking' sensation. The pain began as mild but became constant and severe over three weeks. The patient attributes the onset to overcompensation after the initial injury. The pain persisted during a two-week trip to Hawaii, where the patient hobbled despite the discomfort. The patient consulted Dr. Savage, who suspected a possible avascular necrosis due to chronic pain. An MRI confirmed the diagnosis of avascular necrosis. The patient experienced significant pain relief after the MRI and subsequent treatment. The patient was advised to continue physical therapy and avoid high-impact activities. The patient also reported stiffness when transitioning from sitting to standing and ongoing weakness in the lower extremities. Dr. Savage had previously recommended an MRI and suspected avascular necrosis, but did not disclose this until after results were available. The patient expressed concern about potential progression to arthritis and knee replacement, though the provider noted this is rare. The patient is currently on a rehabilitation plan with physical therapy and is expected to improve over the next few months."
