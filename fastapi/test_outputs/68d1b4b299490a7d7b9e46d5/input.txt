As a seasoned medical scribe specializing in the SOAP template, your task is to transform the transcription of the doctor-patient conversation into a structured brief patient visit note. This note must adhere to the doctor's preferred format, ensuring that all crucial details are captured without the doctor needing to personally document them. Your expertise lies in understanding medical terminology and effectively conveying information in a professional tone. Each section of the patient visit note, such as History of Present Illness and Past Medical History, corresponds to a specific object in the JSON template provided by the doctor. If specific information is absent from the conversation, you will incorporate the default value specified in each template section. Ensure that the final output is formatted as a JSON array of objects, maintaining the same exact order and format as the given doctorâ€™s preferred template. Be meticulous in avoiding any grammatical errors and ensure all sentences are correctly punctuated. This will allow for seamless integration for further processing, such as parsing into an array of objects using Python programming language. Please recheck the sentence and correct any grammatical errors in the following medical-related template. Ensure clarity, professionalism, and proper medical terminology while maintaining a concise and structured format. Make sure the note is very brief and not too detailed will ensure all information is captured.

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: There you go.
Family_member_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: It's big steps. Perfect. Hi.
Patient: Hi.
Doctor_1: How are you? I'm Dr. Lam. Nice, nice to meet you.
Patient: Nice to meet you.
Doctor_1: I was just reading all of your stuff here. So, all right. So it kinda started with one knee and then it went to the other knee.
Patient: Well, I fell.
Doctor_1: Okay, so that was an injury.
Patient: So that was an injury. So left knee, right shoulder, uh, was ... That happened in April.
Doctor_1: Okay.
Patient: And then, uh, then this pelvic bone started to kinda lock up, 'cause I guess I was kinda out. So I had PT for this, I had a PT for this. But as soon as I did this, then this started to hurt, and then, um ... So I had already seen Dr. Savage for this, and then I had called her and I said, "Now I have pain here." So I thought it was from that-
Doctor_1: Yeah. Put your weight on it. Sure.
Patient: ... kind of overcompensating.
Doctor_1: Let me see that. Yeah.
Patient: But she ... After I went in to see her, and I had told her, so, like, it just started as this weird little pain, but then it was, like, constant, you know?
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: And then she's like-
Doctor_1: Pretty severe?
Patient: Pretty severe.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: And then I had ... So it happened, like, the week before I went to Hawaii, and I was there for two weeks, and I just-
Doctor_1: This, this November? Nope?
Patient: Uh, no. End of October.
Doctor_1: October. Okay.
Patient: Right. So, like, whatever Octo-
Doctor_1: But you did ... So you didn't go to Hawaii?
Patient: I did.
Doctor_1: No, I'm just kidding.
Patient: I, uh, went to Hawaii, and I hobbled around Hawaii for two weeks, and then I went back.
Doctor_1: Yeah. Well, if you're gonna hurt, you might as well hurt in Hawaii, right?
Patient: And so, I had ... And then so, um, I had called her office, I'm like, "You know, this pain's really bad. Should I go to the hospital?" They're like, "They're not gonna do anything." So, um, they just-
Doctor_1: So they got, they got you-
Patient: ... Advil, and aclofenac, and he says, "Call us when you get back." And I got lucky. I got in the next day after I came back from Hawaii, I got an appointment, and she's like, "Yeah." And I said, "Well, everybody's been telling me it's, like, a meniscus tear." And she's like, "Well, meniscus tears don't have this kind of, like, constant pain for three weeks."
Doctor_1: Right. About 10%? Yeah, yeah.
Patient: And so then she ... So she goes, "Well, let's just get an MRI." But she had told me after I got the MRI that she suspected that it was sunk.
Doctor_1: And it is sunk.
Patient: It is sunk. Yes.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: And so that's why ... And so she ... But she didn't tell me anything until after the MRI came back.
Doctor_1: Sure.
Patient: So, uh, and then, you know, it was very stressful for me, 'cause she was leaving her practice.
Doctor_1: Where is she going?
Patient: So she said, so she said that she was going back east. So I don't know if she's retired-
Doctor_1: Did you find that out?
Patient: ... or because-
Doctor_1: How old is she? Is she-
Patient: She ... I mean, she looks-
Doctor_1: I feel like she's ... I feel like she's younger than I am.
Patient: She looked good. I thought I had-
Doctor_1: I'm, I'm only 29.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: Uh, so ...
Patient: Well, so you guys might be around the same age as well.
Doctor_1: Okay, all right. Well, she's leaving town.
Patient: But it sounded like she ... Well, what she said was her grown children were back east, her family's back east.
Doctor_1: Oh, okay. So she's
Family_member_2: Yeah.
Patient: ... relocating. So I don't know if she's working or ret- she was leaving.
Doctor_1: Leaving.
Patient: Which made me really sad. And so, um, yeah. Anyway, she was there. I mean, so I'm ... She ... My, my thing with her was that she just was like, I don't ... You know, but she was like, "Let's just get an MRI," and then, you know, uh, she did tell me that she suspected that, because of the chronic pain.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: Uh, and then, uh, yeah. And I saw her on her last day of work, and so she just said because the pain has subsided immensely ... Like, I've been going to PT for-
Doctor_1: So it's better?
Patient: Yes.
Doctor_1: Yeah. That, that, that, that also makes sense. So thi- thi- these things are interesting. They hurt really bad.
Patient: 'Cause it's dying, right? It's like-
Doctor_1: Well, it's not dying, 'cause it's a misnomer.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: If you ask me if pain's just like bone that's dying, it's not really.
Patient: Yeah, I thought she was gonna amputate my leg.
Doctor_1: No, no, no. It's just the blood ... What happens to the blood supply, it gets cut off temporarily. Then you ... Then when you get this bone ... It's almost ... A good way to think about it is a bone bruise. So you get this bone bruise which kills you, and then sometimes you're actually better on the quicker side. I've seen this last nine months, 12 months.
Patient: Wow.
Doctor_1: So the fact that it's been a couple of months and already better is a really good sign. And then they-
Patient: Ah.
Doctor_1: Guess what? As soon as they show up, they get better, and y- you're back to your life. So we don't-
Patient: You know-
Doctor_1: We don't u- ... It's, it's rare. Once in a blue moon, they'll go on to what you're talking about, and then you'll develop arthritis, and they have to do a knee replacement.
Patient: And they have to do a knee replacement, yeah.
Doctor_1: But the fact that you're better is good. Come on up here.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor_1: So in the mean- sometimes in the meantime, if you had seen me in November, I might have gotten it brazed or whatever.
Patient: Oh, I mean, I did all of that.
Doctor_1: Oh, you did all that, right?
Patient: Yeah. No, I was in Hawaii. I had a knee brace, I iced it, I was on diclofenac. I mean, I did it all.
Doctor_1: Yeah, you did all that. You liked it. But the problem is, is like guess what the treatment is? It's time.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: And that's ...
Doctor_1: Also has just
Family_member_2: Okay.
Doctor_1: ... the specifics.
Patient: So yeah. And she just ... And all she told me was that, um ...
Doctor_1: Bring it up. Bring it up. All right, so you got good motion. Yeah. Let me move it down here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good too. So, all right, look. You can sit up if you'd like. I, uh ... You know, you're through the worst of it. That's the good news. Do you want, do you want to go ahead?
Patient: So there is this weird little, like this pocket thing here that's like a Ziploc bag filled with a fluid I guess.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: So that, like, I do have a lot of stiffness, like when I'm sitting, like moving from sittings to standing.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: It takes, it takes-
Doctor_1: Takes like three steps to get going?
Patient: Yeah. I mean, like it's uh, uh, and then it goes there.
Doctor_1: So sometimes when people are at this point, which is like the massive pain is better, but it's still a little bit, I'll do a little physical therapy. I don't know if you've done any of those.
Patient: No, so she gave me an additional six weeks also. I anticipate, um, just with the training of the PT-
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: ... you know, I'll be able to carry that on after.
Doctor_1: You're on, you're on the right track.
Patient: So she did say that there was a possibility that it could take a turn, you know?
Doctor_1: I gen- uh, you never say never with this job.
Patient: Right. I mean, she's not saying, but she said that-
Doctor_1: But gen- I generally don't see that.
Patient: Oh.
Doctor_1: I, I haven't seen. It's be- uh, very rare.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor_1: Just ... But what you wanna do in the meantime is don't, don't do any massive impact stuff. Don't go jogging, don't pound on it yet.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: You know, I'm j- I'm gonna see you in two, three months. At that point, if you're doing good, then we'll release you in a while, you can do anything you want.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor_1: But let's, let's give it a little time, let it heal. You'll get there. Do the PT in the meantime.
Patient: Okay, and then she had said ... I guess you were able to see the meniscus too?
Doctor_1: I don't ... I think that's a red herring.
Patient: She ... Oh, no, no. But she said there was like ... She, she-
Doctor_1: There's a little tear.
Patient: Yeah, there's a-
Doctor_1: There's a little tear in there. I, I think that's an incidental finding.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor_1: I don't think that's anything, so it'll work.
Patient: Okay, so the ... Even ... 'Cause I do feel like when I'm ... So I do have a lot of weakness still, like up and-
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: ... downstairs, right?
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: Um, but I also feel like there's something weird on this side, but it's not ... I know it's not this. But it could-
Doctor_1: Right.
Patient: I mean, there's obviously still some trauma from when I went down.
Doctor_1: Yeah. So, so we're, we're marking time at this point. We'll check you back, we'll see where we are. Hopefully this just gets better as it has been.
Patient: Okay, and then could there ... Uh, I have an open ref- well, I shouldn't say. I had a referral for the left knee PT.
Doctor_1: Okay.
Patient: But I never finished it because the, this happened. So-
Doctor_1: So.
Patient: ... would I, could I possibly then go back to the PT for this thing?
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: Or do I just do the same exercise?
Doctor_1: No, go to, to see us. Go to a PT and they'll ... They're gonna do them both, so.
Patient: Oh, no. They only do-
Doctor_1: No, I mean, they'll show you exercises. They'll do lat- ... Let them put you up for-
Patient: Oh, yeah.
Doctor_1: ... these exercises, yeah.
Patient: Then I just do them both now?
Doctor_1: Yeah, that's right.
Patient: Okay. All right.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: That sounds good. So come back. But looks good.
Doctor_1: Yeah, I mean, you're through the worst of it. That's like I said, you, y- you're lucky, 'cause a lot of times they last longer than that, so you're, you're good.
Patient: Oh, so happy to hear that. Actually-
