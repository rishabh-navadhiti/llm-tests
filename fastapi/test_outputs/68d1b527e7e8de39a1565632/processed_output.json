      "The patient reports a history of knee pain that began after a fall in April, initially affecting the left knee and later involving the right knee and pelvic bone. The pain started as a mild discomfort but progressed to constant, severe pain over several weeks. The patient attributes the worsening to overcompensation after the initial injury. The pain persisted during a two-week trip to Hawaii, where the patient continued to ambulate despite discomfort. The patient sought care from Dr. Savage, who suspected a possible meniscus tear but noted that the chronic nature of the pain was inconsistent with typical meniscus injuries. An MRI confirmed the diagnosis of a bone bruise, referred to as 'sunk' bone, which is consistent with avascular necrosis. The patient experienced significant improvement in pain after the MRI and subsequent physical therapy. The patient reports stiffness, especially when transitioning from sitting to standing, and residual weakness. Dr. Savage advised continued physical therapy and monitoring, with a possibility of progression to arthritis requiring knee replacement, though this is rare. The patient is currently on a rehabilitation plan and is encouraged to avoid high-impact activities."
