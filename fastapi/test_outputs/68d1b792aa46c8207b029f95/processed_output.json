      "Grace Garcia is a 75-year-old right-hand-dominant female who sustained a left distal radius wrist fracture on September 5th while dancing on a cruise. She was placed in a removable left wrist splint and continued with the remainder of her vacation. She presents today for initial evaluation. The fracture is minimally displaced with mild loss of radial height and radial inclination. She has a slight radial deviation of the wrist coinciding with loss of radial height and inclination, and reports ulnar wrist discomfort on supination. There is ecchymosis of the thenar eminence and radial aspect of the wrist. She is neurovascularly intact, with full motor function including the ability to make a composite fist, OK sign, thumb up, and cross the second and third digits. She has a history of diabetes mellitus and a prior right wrist fracture that was surgically repaired on June 15th. She has not had any prior treatment for this current injury. The fracture has impacted her ability to perform daily activities involving the left wrist, particularly those requiring weight-bearing or movement. She discussed treatment options with her provider and agreed to non-operative management with a short arm cast. She is seeking evaluation and management for her acute injury."
