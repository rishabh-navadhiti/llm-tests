As a seasoned medical scribe specializing in the SOAP template, your task is to transform the transcription of the doctor-patient conversation into a structured brief patient visit note. This note must adhere to the doctor's preferred format, ensuring that all crucial details are captured without the doctor needing to personally document them. Your expertise lies in understanding medical terminology and effectively conveying information in a professional tone. Each section of the patient visit note, such as History of Present Illness and Past Medical History, corresponds to a specific object in the JSON template provided by the doctor. If specific information is absent from the conversation, you will incorporate the default value specified in each template section. Ensure that the final output is formatted as a JSON array of objects, maintaining the same exact order and format as the given doctorâ€™s preferred template. Be meticulous in avoiding any grammatical errors and ensure all sentences are correctly punctuated. This will allow for seamless integration for further processing, such as parsing into an array of objects using Python programming language. Please recheck the sentence and correct any grammatical errors in the following medical-related template. Ensure clarity, professionalism, and proper medical terminology while maintaining a concise and structured format. Make sure the note is very brief and not too detailed will ensure all information is captured.

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: Oh, so it's your light that's in this one. Okay. Wait, thank you. Yeah, I think that's it, oh. All right. Let's go see, uh, Laura Garsaloe.
Patient_1: This is Cindy. Is that a good time?
Doctor_1: Why is that the hand signal for changing?
Patient_1: This? I don't think so. Do you have to like this?
Doctor_1: Just changing and she's also doing some kind of weird dance. Uh, but the stuff's in there?
Patient_1: No, I think it's right here.
Doctor_1: Oh.
Patient_1: It's on this side.
Doctor_1: Oh. Wow.
Patient_1: Tomorrow?
Doctor_1: Yeah, we're downstairs tomorrow. We're with you guys tomorrow. You'll join the gang.
Patient_1: You're welcome.
Doctor_1: Uh, all right. So it helped?
Patient_1: It did.
Doctor_1: Okay. Let's do it.
Patient_1: The only thing that I experienced for a couple days last week was no neat pain, but I had tightness here.
Doctor_1: Okay.
Patient_1: I iced it for two days.
Doctor_1: Might be a little swelling because sometimes you'll feel, people will feel swelling like on the outside.
Patient_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: It could've been.
Patient_1: Then we'll know anyway.
Doctor_1: But overall it's, it was an improvement. All right. So I didn't, we didn't want to do both.
Patient_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: We knew, so we can do the other one now. That's good. Yeah.
Patient_1: Okay. We'll do this. And this one?
Doctor_1: Yes. Just to confirm. Uh, let me get, just because I'm feeling nice today, I'll get a little smaller n- needle to do the other one.
Patient_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Get that a little smaller there.
Nurse_1: You know, it's like, "I'm gonna get this done, and then I'm gonna go push out and do this or not." No problem. But you don't need it for today, but then they got a week or two to shoot for. Do 12.
Patient_1: It's working.
Nurse_1: And breathing with it. You got to get over this section, because that's where we are.
Patient_1: Yeah. So you can sleep in it.
Nurse_1: Thank you. You bet. You bet. Yeah, uh... Yeah. Okay.
Doctor_1: That's helpful. How are you? Where do you live?
Nurse_1: Oh.
Doctor_1: Okay, it's you. Okay.
Nurse_1: So, uh- How about you?
Doctor_1: Um, I'm actually up above Eden Canyon Golf Course, so kind of near our other office. And, uh, it was this weird little oasis that did not get touched. Just this circle of, like, no fire. Um-
Nurse_1: Great.
Doctor_1: Yeah, so lucky we're... No gas, no power, so we're not up there yet.
Nurse_1: Mm-hmm.
Doctor_1: We got... We can get up there.
Nurse_1: Mm-hmm.
Doctor_1: Uh, yeah. So, who, what other the doctors down there lived in the area?
Nurse_1: Doctor Quickly.
Doctor_1: Oh, he's in Arcadia. Is his house okay?
Nurse_1: Um, his house is great. Um, the only thing that it affected was, like, his landscape and, I, I believe his plants.
Doctor_1: Oh, he did get some planting, he did some planting.
Nurse_1: Yeah. Mm-hmm. But his house-
Doctor_1: Because he's up there, like, above, like, up- up- up San Andreas.
Nurse_1: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Doctor Guard w- was evacuated.
Doctor_1: He's locking out of it.
Nurse_1: Mm-hmm.
Doctor_1: Right.
Nurse_1: But his house was okay.
Doctor_1: Okay, good. Yeah, I was, like, gonna stop him from saying-
Nurse_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: I think they were worried that wind was gonna blow that all the way over.
Nurse_1: Mm-hmm. Yeah. But overall, the, the other doctors are fine.
Doctor_1: Where's, um... Yeah, where does he live?
Nurse_1: Um, I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
Doctor_1: He's in Arcadia. Um, that's good. How about anyone from the staff down there?
Nurse_1: Um, we had a few employees that were evacuated.
Doctor_1: Okay.
Nurse_1: But they're back at home now.
Doctor_1: Okay, good. And no one lost their homes?
Nurse_1: No.
Doctor_1: Wow. That's-
Nurse_1: No, thankfully. No. One of my, one of the girls, um, her mom was in the midst of it. Like, she had two apartment units.
Doctor_1: Oh, in Pasadena?
Nurse_1: No, Pasadena. They were untouched, but there was surrounding homes that...
Doctor_1: Oh, I should know, I should know. There's something...
Nurse_1: I know, I... Geez. I mean, talk about luck.
Doctor_1: Yeah. Pretty amazing, actually. Looks like more winds today. And I guess I s- I see all these... I saw this big staging area of, um, like, Edison trucks.
Nurse_1: And buildings.
Doctor_1: And brought in donations.
Nurse_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: Are they over here? Where are they?
Nurse_1: They're in the... They park in the Santa Anita.
Doctor_1: Yeah. So I don't know if... Must be over here somewhere.
Nurse_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: Luckily... Yeah. Nothing stopped, right?
Nurse_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: People are people. It's like, I don't get people, like, "I'm not leaving the house." Like, really?
Nurse_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: Like, it's just stuff, man.
Nurse_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: You always get more stuff.
Nurse_1: Just replace all your lights and-
Doctor_1: That's right. But I think people are like, "I don't want to live without..." I don't know, man. Stupid chats. Uh, all right, so we're good. So this can be repeated, um, no sooner than six months. The longer, it's better. So if it's okay, then it's okay.
Nurse_1: Okay. I did get the approval for the therapy. Should I wait four weeks? I think-
Doctor_1: Yeah. No, you don't have to wait four weeks. Just a couple of weeks.
Nurse_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: By the time you make the appointment, it'll probably be time.
Nurse_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: They're, they're probably backed up. So go ahead and do that one now.
Nurse_1: Yeah.
Doctor_1: It's a good idea.
Nurse_1: Okay.
Doctor_1: Yeah. Then why don't you set an appointment in six months anyway? And we'll just hold that spot.
Nurse_1: Can I also get an update fill on the Meloxicam?
Doctor_1: Yeah. Yeah. Do that for you.
Nurse_1: So six months?
Doctor_1: All right. Six months.
Nurse_1: Thank you.
Doctor_1: I'll probably see you down there tomorrow.
Nurse_1: Yes. For sure.
Doctor_1: Okay.
Nurse_1: Thanks so much.
Doctor_1: So you guys weren't downstairs?
Nurse_1: No, we're here. My mom is upstairs.
Doctor_1: Yeah, yeah. I think they're just putting schedulers wherever you are.
Nurse_1: Where are we?
Doctor_1: I think she said she was on the second floor. Which actually is really nice, you get to view the mountains. By the way, do you see the mountains? They're like totally barren.
Nurse_1: They are?
Doctor_1: It's nice. Hey, Maria, you're downstairs. You totally go downstairs. Yeah. That, that would be... I get-
