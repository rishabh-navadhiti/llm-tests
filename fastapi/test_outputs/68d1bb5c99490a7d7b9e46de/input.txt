As a seasoned medical scribe specializing in the SOAP template, your task is to transform the transcription of the doctor-patient conversation into a structured brief patient visit note. This note must adhere to the doctor's preferred format, ensuring that all crucial details are captured without the doctor needing to personally document them. Your expertise lies in understanding medical terminology and effectively conveying information in a professional tone. Each section of the patient visit note, such as History of Present Illness and Past Medical History, corresponds to a specific object in the JSON template provided by the doctor. If specific information is absent from the conversation, you will incorporate the default value specified in each template section. Ensure that the final output is formatted as a JSON array of objects, maintaining the same exact order and format as the given doctorâ€™s preferred template. Be meticulous in avoiding any grammatical errors and ensure all sentences are correctly punctuated. This will allow for seamless integration for further processing, such as parsing into an array of objects using Python programming language. Please recheck the sentence and correct any grammatical errors in the following medical-related template. Ensure clarity, professionalism, and proper medical terminology while maintaining a concise and structured format. Make sure the note is very brief and not too detailed will ensure all information is captured.

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: All right, so now it looked more official. Is Melissa down there? That's okay. We're good. The nice thing is, we have like, uh, we have two ortho techs here, 'cause our ot- other office is closed. So we're gonna be n- hopefully nice and efficient today. Let's see. All right. Let's go see Rosalind Pelham. Her X-rays look good. She's got a little avulsion fracture off the tip of the trochanter on the left side. Let's go see her. Hold me. Hello, everybody. How we doing?
Patient: Hey.
Doctor_1: How are you? I'm Dr Lasser. Nice to meet you.
Patient: Nice to meet you.
Doctor_1: All right. How you feeling?
Patient: Not too bad.
Doctor_1: Okay, good.
Patient: Not too bad.
Doctor_1: Let me show you her picture.
Patient: With all that's been going on.
Doctor_1: Oh, you got ... Where are you guys? Are you ... Oh, well, you said you were evacuated, at the very least.
Patient: No, they kept telling us to go, to go, to go, but my son was a fireman at some point.
Doctor_1: Oh, you were? Okay.
Patient: Yeah, so.
Doctor_1: Yeah, so ... was the power, was the power out though?
Patient: Oh, yeah.
Doctor_1: Yeah, is it still on? It's still ... Oh, it's back though? Yeah, it's back. Oh, that's good.
Patient: Yeah, but I'm ready for today, 'cause they said any wind, they're cutting power.
Doctor_1: I'm sure they'll turn it ... Uh, they're gonna have a low threshold, I'm guessing, to turn that sucker off. Oh, yeah.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: So I, I'm up above Eaton Canyon Golf Course. Ooh.
Patient: Oh, come on. You are?
Doctor_1: So they were ... I don't know if you noticed on the maps, there's that weird circle around the, the Palomar Mesa. It's like fine. The whole neighborhood's just fine. So-
Patient: Oh, thank goodness.
Doctor_1: It's this like weird little oasis. No power, no gas. Right. I mean, right?
Patient: Oh.
Doctor_1: We're shut do- we're shutdown for a little while.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: You know, the fire smelled a little smoky, a little dirty, but, I mean-
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: ... by and large, like- It's by the wind. Well, that was it, right? They started, and then all the wind blew towards Altadena. That's why they got cut off.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: That's really bad.
Patient: And it saved your office too, I thought.
Doctor_1: Well, that was even more of a miracle, because the nursing home next to it burned down.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: The nursing one behind it burned down.
Patient: Ah.
Doctor_1: I guess it's good that our building's made of asbestos or something. Yeah, I'm sure. It's so good. Well, but actually it's, it's stucco, and n- ... I mean, it's not wood, right? Yeah. So I think that helped us.
Patient: It makes a difference.
Doctor_1: I also think, I wonder if the firefighters were in our parking lot, 'cause they were getting all the nursing home patients out. Yeah. So I wonder if that was the staging area, so they don't want it to burn behind them, right? That's not good.
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Doctor_1: And then that damn St. Luke, which I wish had burned to the ground, is still standing.
Patient: Yeah. It's made a difference.
Doctor_1: It's the juice. This one was water. That's right. Yeah, that thing's a stone edifice. It's not at all what it's gonna take to get that thing down.
Patient: Oh.
Doctor_1: Um, so anyway, here's your picture. Um, looks good, let me show you.So, this is the, this is the side here. So, the, everything looks good. The only thing that's a little ... Sometimes when we're in there, there's a little chip fracture off the top of the trochanter.
Patient: Mm-hmm.
Doctor_1: We don't do anything about it. It's not gonna change anything. But just so you know, that's there. We see that. I probably see that in maybe 10% we get that. But it doesn't go anywhere. It's gonna heal back itself. And we don't change any kind of protocol because it's not-
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor_1: It doesn't ha- ... Nothing to do with your weight bearing. But this looks good.
Patient: Okay, good.
Doctor_1: So, let me move this out of the way. Let me see you straighten the ... Move this outta your ... Let me see you straighten, straighten your leg out.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: Good. Can you flex up? Yeah. That's good. A lot of people can't do that with the way.
Patient: Yeah. They need that.
Doctor_1: Let, let me have you stand. We'll take the dressing off. So, therapy has made contact but, uh, I mean, everything-
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: ... this week is probably-
Patient: It's been bad.
Doctor_1: ... gonna have to disappear.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Patient: The guy came.
Doctor_1: Oh, he did come?
Patient: Checked the house out, and then he said, "I'll call you when we get set up." And, uh-
Doctor_1: It's like having to wait for that person.
Patient: ... the power went out.
Doctor_1: Oh, okay.
Patient: The power went out and that was it.
Doctor_1: Okay, I don't worry as much about it with the hips because it's just kind of like you're walking, that's therapy.
Patient: Right.
Doctor_1: But I do want them to come. So, they ... You're in contact with them?
Patient: I am com- ... He's calling him.
Doctor_1: Okay.
Patient: My husband's calling him this morning.
Doctor_1: Okay, great. So you guys will make an arrangement. And this little pooch is normal. I think I told you he might get that.
Patient: Yeah. Yeah.
Doctor_1: So, that'll ... When I see you again in a month, that'll, that'll be gone.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor_1: Let's do this one. Yeah, that's good. So this little skin tape here-
Patient: Uh-huh.
Doctor_1: ... will come off on its own.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor_1: You notice it's like, as it peels up, you can trim it.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor_1: If there's any left when I see you next time around-
Patient: Leave it alone?
Doctor_1: Just leave it alone. You can shower still.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor_1: Don't, don't soak it, no baths or jacuzzis.
Patient: Right. Okay.
Doctor_1: Otherwise, it looks good.
Patient: Okay, great.
Doctor_1: Well, you're doing good.
Patient: Good.
Doctor_1: So, uh, therapy's the name of the game. You okay on medication?
Patient: Yeah. I, I haven't taken hardly any of it.
Doctor_1: All right, I'm gonna put you in the, I'm gonna put you in the brochure.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: So-
Patient: I've taken ... I've got probably about 15, 20 pills left.
Doctor_1: Okay.
Patient: So, I'm good there.
Doctor_1: All right. So, yeah. So, I think we're good. I, I wanna see you in four weeks at this point.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor_1: Keep doing your thing. Obviously when therapy makes contact, they'll show you some things that-
Patient: We'll get started on.
Doctor_1: Yeah, and they'll show you a little protocol.
Patient: And I do some from this leg.
Doctor_1: Yeah, similar. Yeah.
Patient: But-
Doctor_1: Although you probably ... Did you have to protect the weight bearing on that side for a while afterwards or they let you go full?
Patient: Nope. So, I've, I've been doing my exercises that the hospital gave me in the morning and at night.
Doctor_1: That's what you should be doing until they tell you right-
Patient: Yeah, so I've been doing that.
Doctor_1: All right. All right, and they'll give you new things to do once they show up.
Patient: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure they will. Yeah.
Doctor_1: All right, good.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor_1: Guys, we're good. Any questions?
Patient: No, I don't think. We're good.
Doctor_1: All right. I do too. All right, carry on. So, let him know, uh, four weeks up front. We'll see you then.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor_1: All right. Thanks. Nice to meet you.
Patient: Take it easy.
Doctor_1: Uh-huh. Well, which is easier for you?
Patient: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm sure they will. Yeah.
Doctor_1: Guys, we're good. Any questions?
