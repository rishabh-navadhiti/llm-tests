      "A 72-year-old right-hand dominant female presents with a right dorsal cortex triquetral fracture sustained on September 11th, 2025 after falling on an uneven sidewalk and landing on an outstretched right hand. Since the injury, she has been wearing a removable wrist brace, and pain has been manageable with homeopathic and over-the-counter pain medications. She endorses persistent right thumb radial-sided numbness and tingling since the injury and initiation of the brace. The symptoms have not improved with current management. She reports no significant changes in symptoms over time, but notes that the numbness and tingling are localized to the radial side of the right thumb and extend proximally along the radial digital nerve. The symptoms are not alleviated by rest or activity modification. She has not undergone any surgical intervention or formal physical therapy. The condition has impacted her ability to perform fine motor tasks related to her occupation as an artist. She denies any recent trauma or changes in medication use. The patient is concerned about the persistent symptoms and their effect on her daily activities and artistic work."
