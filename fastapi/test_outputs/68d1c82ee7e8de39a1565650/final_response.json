        "Christine Bobish, a 57-year-old right-hand dominant photo editor, sustained a fall while walking on a sidewalk in Santa Monica on 9/14/2025, resulting in left wrist and elbow pain. She experienced pain and limited motion following the fall and was taken to the emergency room at UCLA. Imaging revealed a non-displaced distal radius fracture and a minimally displaced radial head fracture. She was placed in a splint and advised to follow up. She also reported a head injury during the fall, and a CT scan was performed, which reportedly missed a meningioma that she believes is compressing her optic nerve. She has mild soft tissue swelling at the left wrist and elbow, limited range of motion in both joints, and mild effusion in the left elbow. There is tenar spallation over the radial head, lunate facet, and triquetrum, but no spallation at the distal humerus. Neurovascular status is intact distally. She is able to make a fist and extend her fingers, but has pain and limited motion at extremes of flexion/extension and pronation/supination. She is currently under evaluation for fracture management and follow-up imaging."
