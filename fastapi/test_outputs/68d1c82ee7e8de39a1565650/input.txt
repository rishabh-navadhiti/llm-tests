As a seasoned medical scribe specializing in the SOAP template, your task is to transform the transcription of the doctor-patient conversation into a structured patient visit note. This note must adhere to the doctor's preferred format, ensuring that all crucial details are captured without the doctor needing to personally document them. Your expertise lies in understanding medical terminology and effectively conveying information in a professional tone. Each section of the patient visit note, such as History of Present Illness and Past Medical History, corresponds to a specific object in the JSON template provided by the doctor. If specific information is absent from the conversation, you will incorporate the default value specified in each template section. Ensure that the final output is formatted as a JSON array of objects, maintaining the same exact order and format as the given doctorâ€™s preferred template. Be meticulous in avoiding any grammatical errors and ensure all sentences are correctly punctuated. This will allow for seamless integration for further processing, such as parsing into an array of objects using Python programming language. Please recheck the sentence and correct any grammatical errors in the following medical-related template. Ensure clarity, professionalism, and proper medical terminology while maintaining a concise and structured format

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: Uh, married... So she got married, so it was very exciting.
Medical_assistant_1: Oh, nice, Doctor. Actually, I also, uh, wanted to ask you, Doctor. She was on leave, right, Doctor? For one month.
Doctor_1: Yeah, yeah.
Medical_assistant_1: So I thought of asking you.
Doctor_1: Yeah.
Medical_assistant_1: Actually it's a good news, Doctor.
Doctor_1: Yeah, good news. She got married-
Medical_assistant_1: Congrats.
Doctor_1: ... and now she's, she's on her honeymoon with her husband, so.
Medical_assistant_1: Oh, so sweet, Doctor. Congratulate her from, from my side, Doctor.
Doctor_1: I will tell her so.
Medical_assistant_1: Okay, Doctor.
Doctor_1: Okay. Um, Christine Bobish.
Medical_assistant_1: Okay, Doctor.
Doctor_1: Um, she is a 57-year-old right-hand dominant photo editor. Uh, status post trip and fall walking on a sidewalk in Santa Monica with left wrist and elbow pain. Date of injury, 9/14/2025. Diagnosis, left wrist fracture dash closed, left radial head fracture dash closed. Uh, she's here today for evaluation and treatment of her left wrist and elbow. She sustained a fall walking down the sidewalk in Santa Monica. Uh, she had pain and limited motion. She was taken to the emergency room at, uh, at, um, at UCLA. Um, she, uh... Let's see. Uh, she had X-rays and they told her that she had a fracture, and she was placed in splint. Next paragraph of note, she was also, uh... She also hit her head. They did a CT scan, but apparently they missed a meningioma that she was very concerned about, uh, that she states is compressing her optic nerve. On exam, uh, she has mild soft tissue swelling noted at the left wrist and elbow. She has limited range of motion of the wrist and elbow. There's a mild effusion noted of the left elbow. There's tenar spallation over the radial head. There is no tenar spallation at the distal humerus at the lateral or medial sides. She has good range of motion without crepitus, but she does have limited motion at extremes of flexion/extention, and some pain without bony block of pronation/supination. Uh, she's able to make a fist and extend her fingers, uh, but she does have limited wrist range of motion noted. Um, neurovasculally intact distally. X-rays, uh, four views of the left wrist were order call taken reviewed with a patient. That demonstrates no displaced fractures, but there are, um, lucent lines along the, uh, medial column that, uh, are consistent with a non-displaced distal radius fracture. I do not see a scaphoid fracture, um, but one cannot be excluded. Eh, X-rays, three views of the left, uh, elbow were order call taken reviewed with a patient. That demonstrates a minimally displaced radial head fracture. Otherwise, elbow alignment appears concentric. If you could also put under exam, uh, there is no snuff box tenar spallation. No wrist effusion is felt. There is tenar spallation over the, uh, lunate facet. There is some tenar spallation over the triquetrum. Uh, so regarding the wrist fracture, review the X-rays, clinical exam findings, recommend protection with short-arm splint. Recommend repeat X-rays. Regarding the radial head fracture, um, you can do the... Uh, just do, review the X-rays, clinical exam findings, uh, recommend, uh, protected range of motion exercises, warned about stiffness, recommend follow-up with X-rays. Uh, return to clinic in one week for a splint change, recommend follow-up in two weeks for X-rays and reevaluation.
Medical_assistant_1: Okay, Doctor. Thank you.
