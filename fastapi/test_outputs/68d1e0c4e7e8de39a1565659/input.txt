As a seasoned medical scribe specializing in the SOAP template, your task is to transform the transcription of the doctor-patient conversation into a structured patient visit note. This note must adhere to the doctor's preferred format, ensuring that all crucial details are captured without the doctor needing to personally document them. Your expertise lies in understanding medical terminology and effectively conveying information in a professional tone. Each section of the patient visit note, such as History of Present Illness and Past Medical History, corresponds to a specific object in the JSON template provided by the doctor. If specific information is absent from the conversation, you will incorporate the default value specified in each template section. Ensure that the final output is formatted as a JSON array of objects, maintaining the same exact order and format as the given doctorâ€™s preferred template. Be meticulous in avoiding any grammatical errors and ensure all sentences are correctly punctuated. This will allow for seamless integration for further processing, such as parsing into an array of objects using Python programming language. Please recheck the sentence and correct any grammatical errors in the following medical-related template. Ensure clarity, professionalism, and proper medical terminology while maintaining a concise and structured format

### MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT:
Doctor_1: Oh my God.
Doctor_2: All right, so Ms. Lawrence, uh, she... Uh, one sec.
Doctor_1: We can start with the pain.
Doctor_2: Things are all loading up here.
Doctor_1: Yes. Uh, what are we evaluating? Uh, elbow?
Doctor_2: Huh?
Doctor_1: Dislocation, elbow dislocation?
Doctor_2: Yeah, right elbow dislocation. Um, she is a 64-year-old female. She is right-hand dominant. Occupation is a preschool teacher. Uh, no pat- no known past medical history, no smoking history, no known drug allergies. Uh, does not take any, uh, significant medications regularly. Uh, she's presenting after a fall on her outstretched hand on, um, September 18th, uh, 2025. Uh, was diagnosed with a right complete elbow dislocation. Um, here at Cedar Sinai. She was splinted, reduced, um, she has X-ray evidence on the date of injury of, um, a g- good reduction on CT scan.
Doctor_1: Is it-
Doctor_2: Notable for, um, widening of the radiocapitellar joint, uh, suggestive of ligamentous injury. Um, since the injury, she has been taking over-the-counter pain medications, ibuprofen, um, as well as, uh, Norcos, which she was prescribed, and during her emergency department visit. Um, her pain is mostly in the right elbow region. Um, she has been staying in the splint. The splint is intact since the date of injury. On exam, um, within the splint, she's able, she has a normal hand exam. Um, some mild numbness on the radial border of her right thumb. Uh, tenderness predominantly on the, um, radial side, uh, lateral side of her right elbow. Um, however tender throughout the right elbow. Uh, deferred any range of motion, uh, exam due to being in the splint. Assessment and plan, uh, we discussed with the patient that given... Sorry, I guess, to add, sorry, um, to go back to the history, um, patient, uh, we're describing the mechanism of injury. Uh, patient was driving, uh, her, um, was picking up her boss and her boss' children in her, uh, private vehicle when she fell. Um, so this is possibly a workers' comp case. Patient does not have any, um, insurance at this time. So then now moving to the assessment and plan, we discussed with the patient that given her right elbow dislocation as well as the radiocapitellar widening, um, that in that, that is suggestive of ligamentous injury, that we would like to get an MRI to further assess, um, the soft tissue, the possibility of soft tissue injury. However, given her insurance, we are also strongly recommending that she figures out her insurance coverage as if, if surgery is necessary and service coverage would be important. Um, at this time, patient is to remain in the splint, um, until we see her in clinic. Return to clinic in approximately one week. Recommended, uh, conservative management, otherwise with elevation, over-the-counter, um, NSAIDs and pain medication. Um, let's see. And, uh, that's it.
Doctor_1: We can read between. Okay, thank you.
Doctor_2: Thanks.
