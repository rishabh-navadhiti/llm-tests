She was diagnosed with a right complete elbow dislocation at Cedar Sinai, where she underwent splinting and reduction, with imaging confirming good reduction on CT scan. Notable findings included widening of the radiocapitellar joint, suggestive of ligamentous injury. Since the injury, she has been taking ibuprofen and Norcos for pain, remains in a splint that is intact, and reports pain primarily localized to the right elbow region. She has mild numbness on the radial border of the right thumb and tenderness predominantly on the radial and lateral aspects of the right elbow, with tenderness throughout the joint. Range of motion was deferred due to the splint. The injury may be work-related, potentially qualifying for workers' compensation, though she currently has no insurance coverage.
