      "Ori Blumenfield, a 47-year-old right-hand dominant corporate lawyer, sustained a direct blow to the right forearm while playing soccer on 9-14-2025, resulting in an immediate sensation of injury. He presented to urgent care where X-rays confirmed a closed right ulna shaft fracture. He was referred to Andrew Weiss, who placed him in a cast. He is currently being evaluated for ongoing difficulty tolerating the long-arm cast, which extends above the elbow, limiting his ability to wash himself and perform self-care. He expresses concern about enduring the cast for the expected duration. He denies any numbness, tingling, or neurological deficits. He has not experienced any prior similar injuries. The fracture is minimally displaced with good alignment, and no instability is noted at the wrist or elbow. He is otherwise asymptomatic except for discomfort related to the cast. He is motivated to return to normal function and is seeking further management options. He has no known allergies and is not on any medications. He is employed and reports that the injury is significantly impacting his daily activities and quality of life. He has discussed the injury with his primary care provider and the referring surgeon. He is concerned about the length of immobilization and potential need for surgery. He is compliant with follow-up and is seeking a definitive treatment plan."

Old X-rays were also reviewed. CT scan was reviewed for Becky Lawrence, showing increased space at the radiocapitellar joint, indicating possible recurrent instability from a torn ligament. Four views of the bilateral wrists with Rolando views were ordered, taken, and reviewed for Richard Frank, showing no fracture or dislocation, with moderate degenerative changes at bilateral trapezium and carpal joints and mild thumb IP arthritis. Normal shoulder X-rays were obtained for Steve Smith."
