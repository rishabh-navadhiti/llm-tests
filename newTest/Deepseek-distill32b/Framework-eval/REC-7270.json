He first noticed the condition on his left hand and now observes it on his right hand. The left hand is unable to lie flat on the table due to significant contracture of the ring finger. On examination, the left upper extremity shows significant chordation and nodules, with a 45-degree contracture at the ring finger MP joint and a 10-degree contracture at the PIP joint. No measurable contractures are present in the remaining digits. X-rays of the left hand are normal. The right hand examination reveals intact skin with nodules along the long and ring finger rays but no evidence of contracture.",
