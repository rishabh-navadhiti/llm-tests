      "justification": "Accurately includes duration, worsening, and request for injection, but omits the shoulder visit and Dr. Almadroa's observation context present in the benchmark/transcript."

      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Faithfully reproduces the physician's exam wording (clean/dry skin, A1 polii tenderness, walking catching, triggering, excellent ROM, thumbs up). Minor casing and inclusion of 'et cetera' reflect the transcript."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "States that X-rays are normal, but omits the specifics 'three views' and 'left index finger' included in the benchmark/transcript."

    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Lists left index finger pain and trigger pathology; 'triggering on index finger' is clinically equivalent to 'Trigger finger' but not exact phrasing."

      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Conveys plan for trigger finger injection today, consistent with the transcript. The benchmark's 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks' is not in the transcript, so omission is not penalized."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark with accurate patient identification, chief complaint, and verbatim musculoskeletal findings. HPI and imaging are slightly less detailed, and assessment/plan have minor wording differences, but overall fidelity to the transcript and clinical content is high."
