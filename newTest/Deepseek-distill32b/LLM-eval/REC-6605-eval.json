    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Includes correct complaint of left small finger locking/catching but adds 'tethering with finger flexion' from a different patient and is not concise."

    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Captures onset (~2 years) and prior surgery avoidance, but incorrectly states limiting ROM (contradicts 'excellent range of motion') and mixes in exam/imaging details. Not penalizing omission of job impact since that was not in transcript."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Largely matches the exam findings, but not strictly verbatim (e.g., paraphrases 'A1 pulley' as 'trigger point' and minor wording changes)."

      "score": 5,

    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Includes planned trigger finger surgery but adds unrelated plan elements (gentle ROM, video visit in 1 month) and omits 'return in 2 weeks' from benchmark."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note partially captures the correct condition and imaging but repeatedly mixes content from a different patient encounter, leading to inaccuracies in the name, chief complaint, assessment, and plan. There is also a factual error about range of motion. Verbatim requirements for the musculoskeletal section were not fully met."
