  "overall_summary": "The candidate note accurately captured the musculoskeletal exam and plan but omitted key narrative elements, notably the HPI, chief complaint, and assessment. Where the benchmark included information not explicitly stated in the transcript (chief complaint, assessment), the candidate left fields blank. Overall, strong on exam and plan fidelity, weak on history and problem listing."
