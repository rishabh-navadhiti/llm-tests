    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Benchmark contains '-', while candidate includes exam details. Although largely derived from the transcript, it does not match the benchmark's expected '-' and contains slight paraphrase/wording inconsistencies for a verbatim field."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Fully aligns with benchmark: X-rays show MCP osteophyte; ultrasound shows bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte at dorsal MCP and a retinacular cyst superficial to the first dorsal compartment sheath."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Includes two correct active problems (left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst; left thumb MCP osteophyte) matching benchmark. Omits other benchmark items (some not clearly supported by the transcript) and adds vague 'Bilateral' which is unsupported; hence partial credit."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Captures night splints, observation of masses, and 6-week follow-up. Omits 'consider aspiration vs biopsy of the wrist mass' from benchmark. Adds 'for carpal tunnel'â€”consistent with transcript but extra relative to benchmark."

  "total_score": 27,
  "percentage": 77.14,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for patient name, chief complaint, and imaging, and provides a largely accurate HPI. The plan is mostly correct but misses the aspiration/biopsy consideration. Assessment includes key problems but adds an unsupported 'Bilateral' and misses other benchmark items. Musculoskeletal verbatim does not align with the benchmark's expected '-' despite reflecting transcript content."
