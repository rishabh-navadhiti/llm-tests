  "field_scores": {
    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Includes correct full name but adds the honorific 'Mr.', a minor formatting deviation from the benchmark."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Accurately captures 'No pain' but adds extra detail ('wants to know what is going on'), slightly exceeding the concise requirement."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Fully consistent with the benchmark and transcript: follow-up visit, no pain, and desire to understand the situation."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Findings match the benchmark content closely (clean pin sites, no significant tenderness, stable alignment, stiff fingers); only minor punctuation differences."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Matches the benchmark exactly in meaning: X-rays unchanged from last time."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Candidate lists 'Stiff fingers' and 'No pain' (from transcript). Benchmark lists 'Right upper extremity skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation,' which are not stated in the transcript; not penalized for omission. Minor mismatch in content focus."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Includes continuing splint, 10-day follow-up, possible pin removal or repeat X-rays, and transition to phenylplastic splint. Misses referral to Eliza Cherian and the explicit 'review the X-rays' phrasing from the benchmark."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 31,
  "percentage": 88.57,
  "overall_summary": "Strong overall alignment with the benchmark and transcript. Most fields are accurate with only minor formatting or content omissions. The main gaps are the added detail in the chief complaint and the missed referral in the plan."
