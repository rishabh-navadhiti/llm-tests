      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Fully consistent with benchmark and transcript: worsening bilateral thumb pain since 2019 (notably past 6 months), denies numbness/tingling, significant pain/limitation; added relevant history from transcript."

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Benchmark shows '-', while candidate includes exam details. Although transcript supports the content, it does not match the benchmark field content."

    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Captures all key imaging findings from the benchmark (severe CMC changes with osteophytosis, Z deformity, calcific arteriogram on right; similar left without calcific). Minor omission of 'three-view' detail."

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Includes bilateral thumb CMC arthritis and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome but omits right cubital tunnel syndrome and 'skin is intact' item present in benchmark; thus multiple missing elements."

      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Substantially matches benchmark: steroid injection trial with discussion of temporary benefit/rebound pain, observation for CTS/cubital with possible nerve studies, and 2-month follow-up. Missing explicit statement that injections would be done today and specific mention of 'bilateral thumb CMC'."
