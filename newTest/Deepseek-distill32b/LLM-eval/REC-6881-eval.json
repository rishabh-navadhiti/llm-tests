      "justification": "Field requires verbatim text. Benchmark states: 'Right upper extremity skin is cleaned and intact without erythemohymosis.' Candidate paraphrases ('clean' vs 'cleaned', 'erythema or hives' instead of 'erythemohymosis') and adds non-verbatim findings, making it largely non-verbatim and partially inaccurate."

The chief complaint omits the thumb component, and the musculoskeletal section is not verbatim and contains inaccuracies. Overall, the note is largely accurate with notable issues in the verbatim exam section."
