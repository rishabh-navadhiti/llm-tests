      "justification": "Includes doing well, tolerating splint, pain distal to splint, hypersensitivity, and suspected nerve irritation from pressure. Minor omissions (follow-up context, 'increased' pain) and slight paraphrasing."

      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Close to verbatim but not exact; omits 'on the dorsal aspect,' includes ellipses, and slightly alters phrasing, which reduces fidelity to the dictated wording."

      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Captures hypersensitivity related to splint pressure and possible cutaneous nerve irritation, consistent with the transcript. Does not include 'skin intact' and 'no tenderness,' which appear in the benchmark but are not stated in the transcript, so not penalized. Minor wording differences from benchmark."

Minor gaps include omission of 'follow-up' context in the chief complaint/HPI, non-verbatim phrasing in musculoskeletal findings, and slight differences in assessment wording. No significant inaccuracies or hallucinations."
