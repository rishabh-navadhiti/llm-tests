      "justification": "Includes surgical release and risk discussion, but misses multiple benchmark elements: conservative management, context of 'after three injections,' carpal tunnel night splinting (stated as 'night lifting'), and CMC management (no injections today). Not penalizing for 'Return in 2 weeks' since that detail is not evident in the transcript."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note correctly identified the chief complaint, absence of imaging, and most of the assessment, but the HPI deviates from the benchmark and adds an unsupported inference. The musculoskeletal section is not verbatim as required, and the plan omits several key details and contains an inaccuracy ('night lifting' vs 'night splinting'). Overall, partially accurate with notable gaps in HPI and plan fidelity."
