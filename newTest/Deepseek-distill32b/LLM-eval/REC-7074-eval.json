      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Findings are factually consistent (healing incision, minimal scar, excellent finger motion, flexion ~45, extension ~20) but not verbatim; wording altered (e.g., 'without painful post supination' changed to 'without pain, supination') and degrees added."

  "total_score": 28,

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for name, chief complaint, and HPI. Musculoskeletal findings are accurate but not verbatim as required. Imaging is correct but lacks several specific details. Assessment partially matches with one omission and one addition. Plan is largely aligned but misses the explicit 'Return to Pilates.' Overall, strong factual alignment with room for improvement in verbatim quoting and completeness."
