      "justification": "Accurately summarizes follow-up for possible suture removal and improved motion, consistent with transcript and benchmark. Includes an exam detail ('incision is clean and intact'), which is factual but not typically HPI content."

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Not verbatim and omits several benchmark elements (incision status, sutures removed, patient tolerating well, full active extension, 'near tight fist'). Paraphrasing reduces fidelity to the required verbatim format."

      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Candidate lists conditions supported by the transcript (sutures in place, improving motion, post-op ecchymosis) but does not match benchmark items ('skin is intact', 'no tenderness'), which are not present in the transcript; not penalized for missing those, but content diverges from benchmark."

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Correctly notes sutures removed today, aligning with benchmark. However, adds 'Follow-up in 4 weeks,' which conflicts with benchmark (2 weeks) and is not in the transcript; 'continue ROM' from benchmark is not in transcript and not required, but the incorrect interval lowers the score."

Main deficiencies are lack of specificity in the chief complaint, non-verbatim and incomplete musculoskeletal section, divergence from benchmark assessment content, and an incorrect follow-up interval in the plan."
