  "overall_summary": "The candidate note aligns well on patient name and chief complaint, and partially on HPI, imaging, assessment, and plan. Main deficits include omitted benchmark HPI specifics, inclusion of non-benchmark details (e.g., minimally displaced fracture in HPI), a non-matching musculoskeletal verbatim section, and incomplete imaging details. The plan largely matches except for missing the 'sweating' risk and different follow-up timing (not penalized as not in transcript)."
