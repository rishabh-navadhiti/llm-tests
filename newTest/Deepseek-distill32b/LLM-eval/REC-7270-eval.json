      "justification": "Captures onset (left first, now right), inability to lay left hand flat, and reason for visit. However, it misidentifies the contracted finger as the ring finger (benchmark: little finger) and adds exam/imaging details not present in the benchmark HPI."

    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Not verbatim; text is rephrased/cleaned and introduces terms not stated (e.g., 'erythema or edema', 'dense fibrosis') and omits 'no evidence of contracture' on the right. Major deviation from the dictated wording."
    },

      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Benchmark lists 'Dupuytren's contracture' (and a right skin status). Candidate lacks Dupuytren's diagnosis and adds items that belong to exam/plan (nodules, MRI recommended), leading to major content mismatch."

  "total_score": 22,
  "percentage": 62.857142857142854,
  "overall_summary": "Accurate for patient name, chief complaint, and plan. HPI mostly aligns but includes an incorrect finger detail and extraneous exam/imaging content. Musculoskeletal section fails the verbatim requirement with added/altered wording. Imaging omits the MRI recommendation, and the assessment misses Dupuytren's while adding misplaced items. Overall, moderate accuracy with notable section-specific issues."
