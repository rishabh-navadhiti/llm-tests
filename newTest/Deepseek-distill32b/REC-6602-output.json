Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's full name explicitly. The doctor refers to her as "she," so I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient mentions increasing numbness and tingling in her right hand and difficulty feeling things due to a burn on her thumb. So, the chief complaint is "Increasing numbness and tingling in the right hand."

3. **HPI Spencer**: I need to summarize her history. She was diagnosed with lymphoma, completed chemotherapy, is at home more, noticed numbness and tingling in the right hand, burned her thumb, making it hard to feel things and perform tasks like putting earrings on. She's trying to hold her phone less. This should be a coherent paragraph focusing on onset, duration, location, severity, etc.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings include bilateral upper extremity skin being clean, dry, intact without erythema or ecchymosis. Moderate tenderness of the right small finger with triggering and a nodule. Excellent range of motion, PCGs normal. X-ray is clear.

5. **Imaging Results**: The X-ray is mentioned as clear, so that's the imaging result.

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are numbness and tingling in the right hand, trigger finger in the right small finger, and possible carpal tunnel syndrome.

7. **Plan**: The doctor's plan includes another injection for the trigger finger, recommending night splints for carpal tunnel, low threshold for nerve studies, and a follow-up in two months.

I need to ensure each field is filled correctly without adding any inferred information. Let me structure each part as per the instructions.
