Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript starts with "Nicole Coffee" mentioned by the doctor. So, the content should be "Nicole Coffee".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient's main issue is pain in the left index finger. The doctor mentions this directly, so the content is "pain in left index finger".

3. **HPI Spencer**: I need to summarize the history of present illness. The patient noticed the pain a few months ago, it worsened, and she's seeking an injection. The summary should include onset, duration, location, and progression. So, "The patient reports pain in her left index finger for a few months, which has worsened and not improved. She is seeking an injection at this visit."

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings are listed. I'll extract them verbatim: "left upper extremity skin is clean, dry, and tacky without erythema. Acute moderate tenderness on left index finger with an A1 polii. There is walking catching. There is triggering on index finger. Excellent range of motion overall. Able to give a thumbs up, et cetera, et cetera."

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript mentions X-rays of the finger are normal. So, the content is "X-rays of the finger are normal."

6. **Assessment Spencer**: The active problems are pain in the left index finger and triggering on the index finger. So, the list includes both.

7. **Plan Spencer**: The plan is to do a trigger injection today. So, the content is "Trigger injection will be performed today."

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly without adding any inferred information. If any field doesn't have data, use the default "-". But in this case, all necessary information is present.
