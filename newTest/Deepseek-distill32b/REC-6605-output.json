Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript mentions two patients: "He" and "Gianna Saborio." Since the first part is about a male patient, but his name isn't explicitly stated, I'll use "-". The second patient is Gianna Saborio, so that's the name to include.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The male patient's complaint is about his left small finger, specifically locking and catching. Gianna's issue is tethering with finger flexion. I'll list both.

3. **HPI Spencer**: For the male patient, the HPI includes onset two years ago, symptoms of locking and catching, reluctance to seek treatment due to previous surgeries, and current desire for evaluation. For Gianna, her HPI involves tethering after surgery, sutures removed without complications, and some adherence.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings for the male patient include tenderness, a nodule, and well-healed incisions. For Gianna, there's adherence of the incision and good range of motion.

5. **Imaging Results**: The male patient had normal X-rays. Gianna's imaging isn't mentioned, so it defaults to "-".

6. **Assessment**: The male has a trigger finger, and Gianna has tethering post-surgery.

7. **Plan**: The male's plan is surgery. Gianna's plan includes advancing activity gently, avoiding uncomfortable activities, and a follow-up video visit.

I'll structure each JSON object accordingly, ensuring all instructions are followed precisely.
