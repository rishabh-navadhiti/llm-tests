Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's name explicitly. The doctor refers to "she" but doesn't provide a name. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient mentions her wrist pain and limitation in activities. The chief complaint is about the wrist pain significantly limiting her.

3. **HPI Spencer**: The HPI should summarize the history. The patient had a knee replacement, improved synovitis after an injection, started an infusion for osteoporosis, and now wants to discuss wrist arthroplasty due to pain limiting her activities.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor mentions bilateral wrist arthritis and a nodule that's been deleted. So, I'll note the bilateral wrist arthritis.

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript doesn't mention any imaging results, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are synovitis (improved), bilateral wrist arthritis, and knee replacement status post.

7. **Plan**: The doctor plans to evaluate for right total wrist arthroplasty once the knee has recovered enough.

I'll structure each field according to the instructions, ensuring I only use information from the transcript without adding any assumptions.
