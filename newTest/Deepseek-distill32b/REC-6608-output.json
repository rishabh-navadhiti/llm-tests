Alright, I need to extract the medical information from the provided transcript and fill the JSON template accordingly. Let me go through each field one by one.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's name explicitly. The doctor refers to "she," but there's no full name given. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient mentioned that the injection didn't offer relief, but the exact chief complaint isn't clearly stated. It seems to be about pain or an issue that didn't improve after the injection. However, since it's not explicitly given, I'll use the default "-".

3. **HPI Spencer**: The transcript doesn't provide a detailed history of present illness. It only mentions that the injection didn't help and some exam findings. So, I'll use the default "-".

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor notes hypopigmentation at the dorsal aspect of the CMC joint and a positive grind test. I'll extract this verbatim as stated.

5. **Imaging Results**: There's no mention of any imaging in the transcript, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment Spencer**: The assessment isn't explicitly stated, but based on the exam findings, it could be related to the CMC joint issue. However, since it's not directly mentioned, I'll use the default "-".

7. **Plan Spencer**: The doctor recommends a trial of dig verban's injection and a follow-up in six weeks. I'll extract this exactly as dictated.

I need to ensure that each field is filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding any assumptions.
