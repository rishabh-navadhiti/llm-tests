Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript mentions three patients: Miss Stephanie Humphrey, Amit Jaini, and David Schechter. Since the template requires only the patient's name if explicitly mentioned, I'll list all three as they are clearly stated.

2. **Chief Complaint**: Each patient has a different complaint. For Stephanie, it's left wrist pain after a fall. Amit has right small finger pain, swelling, and deformity. David complains of right wrist pain without trauma.

3. **HPI Spencer**: I need to summarize each patient's history. For Stephanie, she fell on 6/21/25, had X-rays showing no fractures, diagnosed with sprain, pain worsened in Massachusetts. Amit injured his finger on 8/2/25 while playing basketball, immediate pain and swelling, X-rays showed a fracture. David's pain started in early 2024, intermittent, worsens with supination and flexion.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: Extract physical exam findings related to musculoskeletal. For Stephanie: mild tendon inflammation over ECU, pain with pro-supination, normal ROM. Amit: ecchymosis, malrotation, shortening, limited motion. David: mild tendinopathy at ECU, no subluxation.

5. **Imaging Results**: Stephanie's X-rays were normal. Amit's X-rays showed a fracture. David's X-rays were normal with mild joint space narrowing.

6. **Assessment**: List active problems. Stephanie has ECU tendonitis and ulnar-sided wrist pain. Amit has a proximal phalanx fracture. David has ECU tendinopathy and joint space narrowing.

7. **Plan**: Each patient's plan is detailed. Stephanie gets therapy, MRI, and follow-up. Amit needs surgery. David's plan is pending but includes evaluation.

I'll structure each patient's information into separate objects within the JSON array, ensuring each field follows the template's instructions.
