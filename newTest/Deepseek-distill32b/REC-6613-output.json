Okay, so I need to help transform the given doctor-patient conversation into a structured patient visit note using the provided JSON template. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, the patient's name. Looking at the transcript, the doctor mentions "Precious Myles Garrett." That's the full name, so I'll put that under PATIENT_NAME.

Next is the Chief Complaint. The patient presented for evaluation of her left wrist pain and masses. So the chief complaint should be concise: "Evaluation of left wrist pain and masses."

Moving on to the History of Present Illness (HPI). The patient is a right-hand dominant social worker with pain in her left wrist that wakes her up at night. She also has masses on her wrist and thumb MCP joint. The pain is more bothersome than the masses. She saw a rheumatologist who did X-rays and an ultrasound. The masses have been constant, not fluctuating in size. On exam, there are specific findings about the masses, but I need to focus only on the history part, not the exam. So I'll summarize that she has constant pain and masses, evaluated by a rheumatologist with imaging done.

For Musculoskeletal findings, I need to extract what the doctor dictated. The exam shows a pea-sized mass over the first dorsal compartment, non-tender, mobile. Another mass at the thumb MCP joint, non-mobile, minimally tender. Range of motion is excellent, no tenderness at A1 point, no locking or catching. So I'll list these verbatim.

Imaging Results: The X-rays showed an osteophyte at the thumb MCP joint. The ultrasound showed a bony avulsion fragment or osteophyte at the thumb MCP and a retinacular cyst in the wrist. So I'll list these as per the transcript.

Assessment should be a list of active problems. From the transcript, the diagnoses are left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte, and bilateral... (though bilateral isn't specified further). So I'll list these as separate points.

Plan: The doctor recommended night splints for carpal tunnel, observation for the masses, and follow-up in six weeks. Also mentioned considering aspiration or biopsy of the wrist mass. So I'll list these as bullet points.

I need to make sure each section follows the instructions precisely, using only what's in the transcript without adding anything extra. Also, ensure proper grammar and medical terminology.
