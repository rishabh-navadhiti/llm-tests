Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript starts with "Precious Myles Garrett" being mentioned by the doctor. So, the patient's full name is Precious Myles Garrett.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient presents for evaluation of her left wrist pain and masses. The chief complaint is explicitly stated as left wrist pain and masses.

3. **HPI Spencer**: The History of Present Illness includes that the pain is more bothersome than the masses, wakes her up at night, and has been constant. She has masses at the dorsal radial aspect of her left wrist and the dorsal ulnar aspect of her left thumb MCP joint. The masses used to fluctuate in size but are now constant. She saw a rheumatologist who did X-rays and an ultrasound.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The physical exam findings are detailed. The left upper extremity skin is clean, dry, and intact. There's a pea-sized mass over the first dorsal compartment, non-tender and mobile. Another mass at the thumb MCP joint is non-mobile and minimally tender. Range of motion is excellent with no tenderness or locking.

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript mentions X-rays showing an osteophyte at the thumb MCP joint and an ultrasound showing a bony avulsion fragment versus osteophyte at the thumb MCP and a retinacular cyst in the wrist.

6. **Assessment**: The diagnoses include left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte, and bilateral issues, though bilateral isn't specified beyond that.

7. **Plan**: The doctor recommends night splints for carpal tunnel, observation of the masses, and a follow-up in six weeks.

I need to ensure each field is filled accurately without adding any inferred information. Now, I'll structure this into the JSON format as specified.
