Okay, so I need to help transform the given medical transcript into a structured patient visit note using the provided JSON template. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, the Patient Name. The transcript mentions "Precious Myles Garrett" as the patient, so that's straightforward.

Next, the Chief Complaint. The patient presented for evaluation of left wrist pain, so that's the chief complaint.

Moving on to the History of Present Illness (HPI). The patient is a right-hand dominant social worker with left wrist pain that's more bothersome than the masses. The pain wakes her up at night, and she wants to know what she can do about it. She was treated by Dr. Ishimori and has diagnoses of a left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte, and bilateral thumb and MCP joint issues. The masses used to fluctuate in size but are now constant. She saw her rheumatologist who did x-rays and an ultrasound of the front of the wrist. She's here for evaluation and treatment.

For the Musculoskeletal examination, the doctor noted a pea-sized mass over the first dorsal compartment, non-tender and mobile. Negative Finkelstein, no pain with thumb extension. Another mass at the dorsal ulnar aspect of the thumb MCP joint, non-mobile, minimally tender, with good range of motion. No tenderness at the A1 point, no locking or catching.

Imaging results include x-rays showing an osteophyte at the thumb MCP joint and an ultrasound showing a bony avulsion fragment versus osteophyte at the thumb MCP joint and a retinacular cyst in the wrist.

The Assessment should list active problems: left wrist pain, left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP joint osteophyte, and bilateral thumb MCP joint masses.

The Plan includes recommending night splints for carpal tunnel, observing the masses, and scheduling a follow-up in six weeks.

I need to make sure each section is filled accurately without adding any information not present in the transcript. Also, ensure proper medical terminology and correct grammar.
