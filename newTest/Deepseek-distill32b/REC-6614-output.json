Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript starts with "Precious Myles Garrett" being mentioned by the doctor. So, the patient's full name is Precious Myles Garrett.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The doctor mentions she presents for evaluation of her left wrist pain. So, the chief complaint is left wrist pain.

3. **HPI Spencer**: The History of Present Illness should be a summary. She's a right-hand dominant social worker with left wrist pain more bothersome than masses, waking her at night. She wants to know what she can do about it. She was treated by Dr. Ishimori and has diagnoses of a left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte, and bilateral thumb and MCP joint issues. The masses used to fluctuate but are now constant. She saw her rheumatologist who did x-rays and ultrasound. On exam, there's a pea-sized mass over the first dorsal compartment, non-tender, mobile. Another mass at the dorsal ulnar aspect of the thumb MCP, non-mobile, minimally tender. No tenderness at A1 point, good ROM. Imaging shows an osteophyte and a retinacular cyst.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The physical exam findings are as dictated: left upper extremity skin clean without anthraea maracunasis. Pea-sized mass over first dorsal compartment, non-tender, mobile. Another mass at dorsal ulnar thumb MCP, non-mobile, minimally tender. Excellent ROM, no tenderness at A1 point, no locking or catching.

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript mentions x-rays showing an osteophyte at the thumb MCP joint and ultrasound showing a bony avulsion fragment/osteophyte and a retinacular cyst.

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are left wrist pain, left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte, and bilateral thumb and MCP joint issues.

7. **Plan**: The doctor recommends night splints for carpal tunnel, observation for the masses, aspiration or biopsy consideration, and follow-up in six weeks.

I need to ensure each field is filled correctly without adding any inferred information.
