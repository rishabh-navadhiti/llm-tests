Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript starts with "Mr. Parviz Mikael," so that's the patient's full name. I'll extract that exactly.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient states he has no pain and wants to know what's going on. So the chief complaint is "No pain, wants to know what is going on."

3. **HPI Spencer**: The HPI should summarize the history. The patient is here for a follow-up, no pain, and mentions stiff fingers. I'll structure this into a coherent paragraph focusing on the onset, duration, and current status without adding any interpretations.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings are "pin sites clean dry and intact without erythema or ecchymosis. No significant tenderness except for parthenonic carpal stable alignment, stiff fingers." I'll extract this verbatim.

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript mentions "X-rays are the same as the last time." So the imaging result is "X-rays same as last time."

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are "No pain" and "Stiff fingers." I'll list these as separate items.

7. **Plan**: The plan includes continuing plexal ligament split, follow-up in 10 days, possible pin removal or repeat X-rays, and transitioning to a phenylplastic splint. I'll list each point as per the transcript.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding any assumptions.
