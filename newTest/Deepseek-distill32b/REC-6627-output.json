Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's name explicitly. The doctor refers to her as "she," so I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient presents with bilateral hand numbness, tingling, and burning pain. That's the chief complaint.

3. **HPI Spencer**: The HPI should summarize her history. She started having symptoms on July 1, 2025. These symptoms are similar to those at the end of her previous pregnancy but are earlier and more intense. She's been seeing her OB, who recommended injections and referred her here. She's been wearing splints without enough improvement.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The exam findings are bilateral upper extremity skin is clean, dry, intact without erythema or ecchymosis. Decreased sensation to the middle fingers is noted.

5. **Imaging Results**: X-rays were deferred due to pregnancy, so no imaging results are mentioned. I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The assessment includes bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral hand numbness, tingling, burning pain, and decreased sensation to the middle fingers.

7. **Plan**: The plan is to defer X-rays, recommend injections, discuss risks and temporary nature, perform injections today, and follow up in three months postpartum if symptoms persist.

I need to ensure each field is filled correctly without adding any inferred information. Now, I'll structure this into the JSON format as specified.
