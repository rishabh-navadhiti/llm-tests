Alright, I need to extract the medical information from the provided transcript and fill the JSON template accordingly. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's full name explicitly. The doctor refers to the patient as "he" and "his," but no name is given. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient presents with index finger pain and stiffness after a laceration. The chief complaint is explicitly stated as "index finger pain and stiffness."

3. **HPI Spencer**: The History of Present Illness should be a summary. The patient lacerated his finger on 7-16-25 while working with a chisel. He went to urgent care, had the wound irrigated and repaired, sutures removed after 14 days, but the wound reopened. Now he has a stiff index finger with limited flexion and swelling.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings are: left upper extremity with a well-healing laceration without sutures, stiff index finger PIP with limited flexion, moderate swelling, no sensory tenderness, and good range of motion in other digits.

5. **Imaging Results**: The doctor mentions X-rays were taken and are normal.

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are index finger PIP laceration and stiff finger.

7. **Plan**: The plan includes hand therapy and a follow-up in four weeks.

I'll structure each field according to the instructions, ensuring verbatim where needed and summarizing appropriately.
