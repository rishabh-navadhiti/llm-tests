Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

Starting with "Patient Name" (PATIENT_NAME). The transcript mentions several patients: Chaz Thomas, Meesha Senuda, Grace Twan, Charles Shaw, and Josefina Marcial. Each of their names is explicitly stated, so I'll list each as separate entries in the content array.

Next is "Chief Complaint" (CHIEF_COMPLAINT). For each patient, I need to identify their main issue. Chaz's complaint is about his splint after someone else's blood got on it. Meesha is dealing with sensitivity and stiffness in her PIP joint. Grace is here for MRI review and injection effects. Charles is following up on his hand after an injection. Josefina is concerned about her right hand pain and considering a left wrist injection.

Moving on to "HPI Spencer" (HPI_SPENCER). This requires a summary of each patient's history. Chaz had a laceration, removed sutures, some pain, and limited flexion. Meesha has been wearing a splint and has improving but still stiff PIP. Grace has a mass and systemic symptoms. Charles has mild laceration and is doing well. Josefina experienced severe pain after an injection but is improving.

For "Musculoskeletal" (MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM), I need verbatim exam findings. Chaz has a clean laceration with sutures removed, some pain, and limited flexion. Meesha has limited flexion at DIP, stiffness, minimal tenosynovitis, and hypersensitivity. Grace's exam is unchanged. Charles has a mild laceration and needs to protect his hand. Josefina shows tenosynovitis, ulnar prominence, and limited motion.

"Imaging Results" (IMAGING_RESULTS) should include any mentioned imaging. Grace had an MRI, but the results aren't detailed here. Josefina had X-rays showing ulnar prominence and arthritis. Others didn't mention imaging results, so they default to "-".

"Assessment" (ASSESSMENT_SPENCER) lists active problems. Chaz has laceration healing with pain and limited flexion. Meesha has PIP stiffness improving. Grace has a mass and systemic symptoms. Charles has a mild laceration. Josefina has wrist arthritis and tenosynovitis.

Finally, "Plan" (PLAN_SPENCER_) includes the doctor's instructions. Chaz gets a removable splint and hand therapy. Meesha stops splinting at night, exercises, and defers therapy. Grace follows up in three months. Charles continues dressings. Josefina tries splints and exercises for her left wrist.

I need to ensure each field is filled correctly without adding any inferred information, only using what's explicitly stated.
