Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript mentions "Nadeem Nemi- ... at two o'clock on Dr. Almadro's schedule." So the patient's full name is Nadeem Nemi.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient presents for evaluation of bilateral thumb pain, which has worsened since 2019, especially over the last six months. So the chief complaint is "Bilateral thumb pain."

3. **HPI Spencer**: The patient is a right-handed male retiree with a history of bilateral carpal tunnel, right cubital tunnel, and bilateral thumb CMC arthritis. He reports worsening thumb pain over the last six months without numbness or tingling, limiting his activities.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The exam findings include bilateral upper extremity skin clean, dry, intact; no significant soft tissue swelling; positive Grin and shoulder sign; no triggering of digits; dot NCTS.

5. **Imaging Results**: X-rays show severe joint space neovasculitis with osteophytosis, Z deformity, hyperextension at MCP joint, and calcific arteriogram on the right. The left is similar without the calcific arteriogram.

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are bilateral thumb CMC arthritis with progression and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome improving.

7. **Plan**: The plan includes steroid injections, discussing their temporary nature and rebound pain, recommending observation for carpal tunnel, considering nerve studies, and a follow-up in two months.
