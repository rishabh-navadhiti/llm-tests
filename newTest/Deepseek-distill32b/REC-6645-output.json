Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's full name explicitly. The doctor refers to him as "he" and mentions "Nadeem Nemi" but that seems to be the doctor's name. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient presents for evaluation of bilateral thumb pain. The doctor states, "He presents today for evaluation of his bilateral thumb- ... uh, pain." So, the chief complaint is "Bilateral thumb pain."

3. **HPI Spencer**: The HPI should summarize the history. The patient has bilateral carpal tunnel, right cubital tunnel, and bilateral thumb CMC arthritis. He received injections today. His thumb pain has worsened since 2019, especially over the last six months. No numbness or tingling, but significant pain limiting his thumbs. So, the HPI is a concise paragraph covering onset, duration, location, severity, and progression.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings include bilateral upper extremity skin clean, dry, intact; no significant soft tissue swelling; positive grind and positive shoulder sign; no triggering of digits. So, I'll extract this verbatim.

5. **Imaging Results**: The X-rays show moderate joint space neovasculitis (corrected to neovascularization?), severe osteophytosis, Z deformity with hyperextension of MCP joint, and calcific arteriogram noted on the right. The left is similar without the calcific arteriogram. So, I'll list these findings as per the transcript.

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are bilateral thumb CMC arthritis with progression, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and right cubital tunnel syndrome. These are the conditions mentioned as current issues.

7. **Plan**: The doctor recommends injections today, discusses their temporary nature and rebound pain. For carpal and cubital tunnels, observation and possible nerve studies. Follow-up in two months. So, the plan includes these points verbatim.

I need to ensure each field is filled correctly without adding any inferred information. Let me double-check each section against the transcript to confirm accuracy.
