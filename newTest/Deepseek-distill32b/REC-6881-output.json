Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's name explicitly. The doctor refers to "She" but doesn't provide a name. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient mentions pain in the middle finger, specifically that it's locking and catching again. So, the chief complaint is "Middle finger pain with locking and catching."

3. **HPI Spencer**: The HPI should summarize the history. The patient had a thumb issue resolved with cycloprox. The middle finger started having issues after an injection helped temporarily. It's now painful again. So, the HPI is a concise paragraph covering onset, duration, and progression.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings include the right extremity skin being clean, intact, no erythema. Tenderness at the middle finger A1 pulley with triggering. No onychomycosis, thumb fully grown with good cosmesis.

5. **Imaging Results**: There's no mention of any imaging done, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are thumb pain (resolved) and middle finger trigger symptoms (recurrent). So, two items in the list.

7. **Plan**: The doctor recommends continuing cycloprox, another injection for the middle finger, and activity as tolerated. So, three bullet points.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly without adding any inferred information. Each content field should strictly follow the instructions, using verbatim where required and summarizing where needed.
