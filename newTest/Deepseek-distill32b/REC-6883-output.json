Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's name explicitly. The doctor refers to "He" but doesn't provide a name. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient mentions two falls and wrist pain. The chief complaint is about the wrist pain after the falls. So, I'll note "Wrist pain after two falls over the last two days."

3. **HPI Spencer**: The patient fell twice, once on a slide and once off a scooter. After both, he had wrist pain, especially on extension, which didn't improve. I'll summarize this as a coherent paragraph focusing on onset, duration, location, and symptoms.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings include moderate swelling, mild ecchymosis, and pain with extension. I'll extract these verbatim.

5. **Imaging Results**: The X-rays show a dorsal distal radius fracture. I'll note this exactly as stated.

6. **Assessment**: The main issue is the wrist fracture. So, the assessment is "Left wrist fracture."

7. **Plan**: The plan includes casting and follow-up in two weeks with X-rays and cast change. I'll list these as per the transcript.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding any assumptions.
