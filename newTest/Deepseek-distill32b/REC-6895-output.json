Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's full name explicitly. The doctor refers to "PO1" and "he," but no full name is given. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient mentions having some feedback and feeling funny when in certain positions. The doctor notes limited finger motions. So, the chief complaint is about limited finger motion and discomfort.

3. **HPI Spencer**: The patient reports minimal pain but some feedback and discomfort in certain positions. The exam shows limited right and small finger motions, with the ulnar gutter splint in place. There's minimal fracture healing. I'll summarize this into a coherent paragraph focusing on the history without exam findings.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor mentions limited right and small finger motions, extra footstep stable, minimal fracture healing, and the ulnar gutter splint. I'll extract these verbatim.

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript doesn't mention any imaging results, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The patient has limited finger motion and minimal fracture healing. These are the active issues, so I'll list them.

7. **Plan**: The doctor plans to continue protecting with a splint, continue non-weight bearing, follow up in 3 weeks, transition to a thermoplastic clip, and provide therapy prescription. I'll list these as per the transcript.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding any assumptions.
