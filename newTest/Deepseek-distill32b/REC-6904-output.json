Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript mentions "Jane Pollock" explicitly. So, I'll put that in the content.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient says she's "sore and stiff, but Not Too painful." That's her main issue, so that's the chief complaint.

3. **HPI Spencer**: The HPI should summarize her history. She's following up after surgery, has some bruising, and her incisions are dry with sutures. Her fingers are in a flex position with limited movement. I'll structure this into a coherent paragraph without adding any interpretations.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor mentions "moderate ecchymosis to the palm" and the fingers' position. I'll extract this verbatim as per the instruction.

5. **Imaging Results**: There's no mention of any imaging in the transcript, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The active issues are postoperative state, ecchymosis, and limited finger movement. I'll list these as concise points.

7. **Plan**: The plan includes removing dressings, returning in 6 days, and follow-up for suture removal and therapy. I'll list these exactly as stated.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding anything extra.
