Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template accordingly. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript starts with "Doctor: Walt is a PO1..." So the patient's name is Walt. I'll extract that exactly.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The doctor mentions Walt has "huge day" and states he hasn't had much pain but wants to know when numbness will resolve. The chief complaint seems to be about numbness, so I'll note that.

3. **HPI Spencer**: The HPI should summarize the history. The doctor says Walt is a PO1 with carpal tunnel, has had some numbness, and now has moderate ecchymosis post-op. I'll structure this into a coherent paragraph focusing on onset, duration, and current status.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The exam findings include incision clean, joint sutures, moderate ecchymosis, good finger motion but not full. I'll extract this verbatim as per instruction.

5. **Imaging Results**: There's no mention of any imaging in the transcript, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are post-op carpal tunnel and residual numbness. I'll list these as concise points.

7. **Plan**: The plan is a post-op endo carpal tunnel and follow-up in 4 weeks. I'll extract this exactly as dictated.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding any assumptions.
