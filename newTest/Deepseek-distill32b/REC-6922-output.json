Okay, so I need to help transform this doctor-patient conversation into a structured patient visit note using the provided JSON template. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, I'll look at the JSON template provided. It has several sections like Patient Name, Chief Complaint, HPI Spencer, Musculoskeletal, Imaging Results, Assessment, and Plan. Each section has specific instructions on what to extract from the transcript.

Looking at the transcript, it's a series of conversation snippets with speakers and timestamps. The doctor mentions Mahika Mahendru is here for follow-up. So, the patient's name is Mahika Mahendru. That goes into the PATIENT_NAME field.

Next, the Chief Complaint. The patient mentions pain around the joint distal to the splint. So, the chief complaint is pain around the joint distal to the splint.

For the HPI Spencer section, I need to summarize the history of present illness. The doctor says she's tolerating her splint without complaint but has hypersensitivity distal to the splint. The splint is putting pressure, and there's mild soft tissue swelling. The pain is from irritation of the mutaneous nerve due to splint pressure. So, I'll structure this into a coherent paragraph focusing on onset, duration, location, severity, and treatments.

Moving on to Musculoskeletal findings. The doctor notes that the splint is in place, there's mild soft tissue swelling, significant hypersensitivity, and inability to sublux extensor tendons. Also, excellent PAP in the splint. I'll extract these verbatim as per the instruction.

Imaging Results: There's no mention of any imaging in the transcript, so I'll use the default value "-".

Assessment: The active problems are hypersensitivity distal to splint and mutaneous nerve irritation. These are symptom-based and diagnosis-related.

Plan: The doctor recommends modifying the splint and returning to the clinic if no improvement or in 3 weeks. I'll list these as per the instructions.

I need to ensure all sections are filled correctly, using defaults where information isn't present. Also, maintaining proper grammar and medical terminology is crucial. Let me double-check each section against the transcript to make sure nothing is missed.
