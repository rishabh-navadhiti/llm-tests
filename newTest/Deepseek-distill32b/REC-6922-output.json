Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript starts with "Mahika Mahendru is here today for follow-up." So the patient's full name is Mahika Mahendru. I'll put that in the content.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient mentions "pain around the joint distal to the splint." That's her main concern, so that's the chief complaint.

3. **HPI Spencer**: I need to summarize the history. She's doing well overall, tolerating the splint, but has hypersensitive pain around the joint. The splint is causing pressure, leading to irritation of the mutaneous nerve. I'll structure this into a coherent paragraph focusing on onset, duration, location, etc.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings are "splint is in place. There's mild soft tissue so that there is significant hypersensitivity distal to the splint. The splint is putting a fair amount of pressure... unable to sublux the extensor tendons in the splint. She has excellent PAP." I'll extract these verbatim.

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript doesn't mention any imaging, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are hypersensitivity due to splint pressure and possible mutaneous nerve irritation. I'll list these as concise points.

7. **Plan**: The doctor recommends modifying the splint and returning to the clinic if no improvement or in 3 weeks. I'll note these exactly as stated.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding anything extra.
