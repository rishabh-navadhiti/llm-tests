Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript mentions "Magara" as the patient's name. I'll extract that exactly.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient presents for evaluation of bilateral hand numbness and tingling. That's the chief complaint.

3. **HPI Spencer**: I'll summarize the history. It started in January 2025 without trauma, causing sleep disturbance. She uses night braces which help, denies pain or motion issues.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings include bilateral upper extremity skin intact, minimal swelling, and specific joint space narrowing in the hands.

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript mentions X-rays showing joint space narrowing in both hands, especially at the thumb MCP and carpal joints.

6. **Assessment**: The conditions are bilateral hand numbness/tingling, features of carpal tunnel, and peripheral neuropathy.

7. **Plan**: The plan includes nerve studies, follow-up in 6-8 weeks, and considering carpal tunnel treatment.

I'll ensure each field is filled accurately without adding any inferred information.
