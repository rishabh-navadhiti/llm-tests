Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's full name explicitly. The doctor refers to "She" but doesn't provide a name. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient mentions her right ring finger trigger finger came back. So, the chief complaint is "Right ring finger trigger finger."

3. **HPI Spencer**: The patient states she's doing well with her thumb but her trigger finger returned around 2020. She had 3 injections but it's recurring. I'll summarize this into a coherent paragraph focusing on onset, duration, and treatments.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings are mild tenderness in the thumb CMC joints and triggering in the right ring finger with tenderness at the pulley. I'll extract this verbatim.

5. **Imaging Results**: There's no mention of any imaging in the transcript, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are CMC arthritis and right ring finger trigger finger. I'll list these as separate items.

7. **Plan**: The doctor recommends surgical release after discussing risks and continuing night lifting. I'll extract this exactly as dictated.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding any assumptions.
