Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's name explicitly. The doctor refers to her as "she," so I can't extract a name. I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient is noticing continued soft tissue swelling, especially when active with her hand. She's wondering if it's normal. So, the chief complaint is about the swelling and its normalcy.

3. **HPI Spencer**: I need to summarize her history. She had hypersensitivity two weeks ago, which improved over the last week. Her sensation has significantly improved. The HPI should include onset, duration, and progression. I'll structure it into a coherent paragraph focusing on these points without adding any exam findings.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings include well-healed incision, minimal scar, full range of motion, slight extension lag, and improving sensation. I'll extract these verbatim as they are dictated.

5. **Imaging Results**: There's no mention of any imaging in the transcript, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The active issues are soft tissue swelling and hypersensitivity improving. These are the symptoms mentioned, so I'll list them as the assessment.

7. **Plan Spencer**: The plan includes weaning the splint, advancing activity and ROM, and a follow-up in 3 months. I'll extract this exactly as stated.

I need to ensure each field is filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding anything extra. Let me double-check each section to make sure I haven't missed anything or added any assumptions.
