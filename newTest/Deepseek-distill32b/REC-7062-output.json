Okay, so I need to process this medical transcript and fill out the JSON template provided. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully.

The conversation is between a doctor and a patient. The doctor mentions that the patient is doing well overall but has noticed some continued soft tissue swelling, especially when she's more active with her hand. She's wondering if this is normal. Her sensation has improved a lot; she had hypersensitivity two weeks ago, but it's much better now.

On examination, the incision is well healed with minimal scarring and no firmness. The patient has excellent range of motion, can make a full fist without pain, and can lay her hand flat on the table. There's a slight extension lag of less than 5 degrees compared to her baseline. Sensation is decreased but improving in one digit.

The plan is to wean the splint, advance activity and range of motion, and return to the clinic in three months for follow-up.

Now, I'll go through each section of the JSON template and extract the necessary information.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's name, so I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient is concerned about continued soft tissue swelling in her hand when active. So, the chief complaint is "Continued soft tissue swelling in the hand when active."

3. **HPI Spencer**: I need to summarize the history of present illness. The patient reports improvement in sensation but still has some hypersensitivity. The swelling is noticed when active. I'll structure this into a coherent paragraph focusing on onset, duration, location, severity, and progression.

4. **Musculoskeletal**: The physical exam findings include well-healed incision, minimal scar, no firmness, excellent range of motion, full fist without pain, slight extension lag, and improving sensation in one digit. I'll list these verbatim as per the instruction.

5. **Imaging Results**: There's no mention of any imaging in the transcript, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are soft tissue swelling and decreased sensation improving in one digit. I'll list these as concise points.

7. **Plan**: The plan includes weaning the splint, advancing activity and range of motion, and a follow-up in three months. I'll list these exactly as dictated.

I need to ensure that all sections are filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding any assumptions or interpretations. Also, I must maintain proper grammar and punctuation for clarity.
