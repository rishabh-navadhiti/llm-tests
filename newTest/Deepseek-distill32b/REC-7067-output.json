Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's full name explicitly. The only name mentioned is "Lindsay Demash," but that's the doctor's name. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient noticed a mass or bump at the ulnar border of her index finger DIP joint a few weeks ago. So, the chief complaint is "Mass/bump at ulnar border of index finger DIP joint."

3. **HPI Spencer**: The patient noticed the mass a few weeks ago, it doesn't limit her function, and she's concerned because it's different from her arthritis bumps. On exam, there's a mass at the DIP joint with osteophytes and good range of motion. She's doing well overall, able to lift weights, but still has some wrist pain.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The physical exam findings include a mass at the DIP joint, evidence of Heberden's nodes, osteophytes, and excellent range of motion.

5. **Imaging Results**: No imaging results are mentioned in the transcript, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are the mass at the DIP joint, Heberden's nodes, and wrist arthritis.

7. **Plan**: The plan includes continuing the home exercise program, advancing activities, and following up in 6 months.
