It does not limit her function but is concerning as it differs from her arthritis-related bumps. On examination, there is a mass at the DIP joint with evidence of Heberden's nodes and osteophytes. She reports overall improvement in wrist function and ability to perform activities without pain, though she still experiences some wrist discomfort."
