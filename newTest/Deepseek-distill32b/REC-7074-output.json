Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript mentions "Math is a dominant a stay at home mom." So, the patient's name is Math.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient presents for evaluation of her left wrist stiffness. So, the chief complaint is "Left wrist stiffness."

3. **HPI Spencer**: I need to summarize the History of Present Illness. The patient fell in October 2023, resulting in a left distal radius fracture. She was diagnosed with CRPS and has made progress but still can't extend her wrist enough for a push-up. She does Pilates without pain but needs modifications. On exam, her incision is healing well, minimal scar, good finger motion, flexion to 45 degrees, extension to 20 degrees. X-rays show a well-healed fracture with hardware.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's physical exam findings are: incision healing well, minimal scar, excellent finger motion without pain, supination, flexion to 45 degrees, extension to 20 degrees.

5. **Imaging Results**: The X-rays show a well-healed fracture with hardware in place.

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are left wrist stiffness and CRPS.

7. **Plan**: The plan includes reviewing X-rays, noting good plate alignment, discussing limited motion for push-ups, recommending advancing activities, and scheduling a follow-up in 3 months.

I'll structure each field according to the template instructions, ensuring verbatim extraction where required and summarizing as needed without adding any inferred information.
