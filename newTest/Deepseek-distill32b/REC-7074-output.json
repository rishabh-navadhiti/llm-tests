Okay, so I need to process this medical transcript and fill out the JSON template provided. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient's name. The transcript mentions "Math is a dominant a stay at home mom." So, her name is Math. I'll note that under PATIENT_NAME.

Next, the Chief Complaint. She's presenting for evaluation of her left wrist stiffness. So, the chief complaint is "Evaluation of left wrist stiffness."

Moving on to the History of Present Illness (HPI). She had a fall in October 2023, resulting in a left distal radius fracture. She was treated by Doctor Andrew Rice. Post-op, she was diagnosed with CRPS but has made progress. However, she still can't extend her wrist enough for a push-up. She does Pilates regularly without pain but needs modifications. On exam, her incision is healing well with minimal scar, excellent finger motion, no pain. Wrist flexion is 45 degrees, extension 20 degrees. X-rays show a well-healed fracture with hardware in place.

For the Musculoskeletal section, the exam findings are: incision healing well, minimal scar, excellent finger motion without pain, flexion to 45 degrees, extension to 20 degrees.

Imaging Results: X-rays show a well-healed fracture with hardware in place.

Assessment should list her active problems: Left distal radius fracture (status post-op), Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), and Limited wrist motion.

Plan includes reviewing X-rays, discussing that she likely won't regain enough motion for push-ups but shouldn't limit herself beyond that. Recommend advancing activities and follow-up in 3 months.

I need to make sure each section is filled accurately without adding any inferred information. Also, ensure proper medical terminology and correct grammar.
