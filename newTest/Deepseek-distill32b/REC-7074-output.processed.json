      "The patient, a stay-at-home mom, sustained a left distal radius fracture in October 2023 following a fall. She was treated by Doctor Andrew Rice. Post-operatively, she was diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). While she has made progress, she continues to experience stiffness and limited wrist extension, preventing her from performing push-ups. She regularly engages in Pilates without pain but requires modifications. On examination, her incision is healing well with minimal scarring, and she has excellent finger motion without pain. Wrist flexion is 45 degrees, and extension is 20 degrees. X-rays reveal a well-healed fracture with hardware in place."
