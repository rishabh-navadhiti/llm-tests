Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template accordingly. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript starts with "Bertha Campos". That's the patient's full name, so I'll put that in the content.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The doctor mentions she's here for a follow-up. So her chief complaint is "Follow-up".

3. **HPI Spencer**: The HPI should summarize her history. She's been working on her motion and feels it's improving. She wants her sutures out. The incision is clean and intact. So I'll note that she's improving and wants sutures removed.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor notes range of motion is near full, no pain, no triggering, moderate ecchymosis. I'll extract that verbatim.

5. **Imaging Results**: There's no mention of any imaging in the transcript, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The issues are sutures in place, improving motion, and post-op ecchymosis. I'll list these as separate points.

7. **Plan**: The doctor removes the sutures and advises follow-up in 4 weeks. I'll note that as the plan.

I need to make sure each field follows the instructions, using verbatim where required and summarizing where needed. No extra info, just what's in the transcript.
