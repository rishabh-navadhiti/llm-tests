Okay, so I need to process this medical transcript and fill out the JSON template provided. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully.

The conversation starts with the doctor saying, "Sweet little thing. Um, Bertha Campos, who is here today for follow-up she suits and he's doing well overall." So, the patient's name is Bertha Campos. That goes into the PATIENT_NAME field.

Next, the chief complaint. The patient is here for a follow-up, so her main reason is to have her sutures removed. So, the chief complaint should be about the sutures. I'll phrase it as "Follow-up for suture removal."

Moving on to the HPI Spencer section. The doctor mentions that Bertha has been working on her motion and feels it's getting better. She wants to know if she can have her sutures out. On exam, the incision is clean and intact, and the sutures were removed without complications. Her range of motion is near full, no pain, no triggering, and some ecchymosis consistent with post-op. I'll summarize this into a coherent paragraph focusing on her history and current status.

For Musculoskeletal findings, the doctor notes the incision is clean and intact, sutures removed without issues. Range of motion is near full, no pain, no triggering, moderate ecchymosis. I'll extract this verbatim as per the instructions.

Imaging Results aren't mentioned in the transcript, so I'll leave that as "-".

Assessment should list active problems. She's status post surgery with improving motion and some ecchymosis. So, I'll include "Status post surgery" and "Improving range of motion."

The Plan section includes removing sutures today, noting the incision is clean. The doctor advises her to continue working on motion and follow up in 4 weeks. I'll list these points as per the transcript.

I need to make sure all sections are filled correctly, using only the information provided without adding anything extra. Also, ensure proper grammar and punctuation throughout.
