Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript mentions "Doctor Goller" and "Jack," but the patient's name isn't explicitly stated. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient mentions "not possible fracture" and "post-traumatic arthritis." That's the chief complaint.

3. **HPI Spencer**: The patient reports that his splint broke after lifting weights, leading to a follow-up visit. He has post-traumatic arthritis and no fracture. I'll summarize this into a coherent paragraph.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor notes "excellent PIP motion in the splint, no specific limited motion." I'll extract this verbatim.

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript mentions X-rays were deferred, so I'll note that.

6. **Assessment**: The active conditions are post-traumatic arthritis and splint breakage. I'll list these as bullet points.

7. **Plan**: The plan includes protecting with relative motion, returning in 6-8 weeks, and continuing with the splint. I'll extract these points as dictated.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding any assumptions.
