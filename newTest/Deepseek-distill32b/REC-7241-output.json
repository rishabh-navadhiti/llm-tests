Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript mentions "James" as the patient. I'll extract that exactly.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The doctor mentions "recurrence of his trigger on his right side and new triggering on the left side." So, the chief complaint is about trigger finger on both sides.

3. **HPI Spencer**: The HPI should summarize the history. The patient had surgery with Dr. Hertz, and now there's a recurrence on the right and new issue on the left. The exam shows moderate swelling and a nodule causing triggering.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings are moderate soft tissue swelling, triggering of the middle finger, and a nodule.

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript doesn't mention any imaging results, so I'll use the default "-".

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are trigger finger on both sides and status post surgery.

7. **Plan**: The plan includes deferring injection on the right, doing it on the left, and following up with Dr. Hertz.

I'll make sure each field is filled correctly without adding any inferred information.
