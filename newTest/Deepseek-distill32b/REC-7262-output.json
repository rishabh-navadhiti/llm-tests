Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript mentions "Kabe Tahiri" and "Hoy Berlin". Since both are patients, I'll list them as separate entries. The instruction says to return only the patient names, so I'll include both.

2. **Chief Complaint**: For Kabe, the main issue is his neck, but he hasn't seen anyone for it. Hoy's complaint is about his cast being uncomfortable. I'll note these as their chief complaints.

3. **HPI Spencer**: Kabe's HPI isn't detailed, so I'll note that his exam is unchanged. Hoy's HPI includes the cast being scratchy and causing discomfort, leading to skin issues.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctors mention Hoy's wrist and fingers, so I'll extract those findings verbatim.

5. **Imaging Results**: X-rays show increased callus formation on both wrists. I'll note that as per the transcript.

6. **Assessment**: Kabe's assessment is neck pain with no change. Hoy's includes wrist issues and cast-related skin problems.

7. **Plan**: For Kabe, follow-up in a year. Hoy's plan includes transitioning to a short arm cast and removable splint, with follow-up in 4 weeks.

I need to ensure each field is filled correctly, using only the information from the transcript without adding anything extra.
