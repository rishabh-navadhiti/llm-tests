Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's name explicitly. The doctor refers to him as "Dominant retiree," but that's not a name. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient presents for evaluation of contraction of bilateral hands that began many years ago. So, the chief complaint is "contraction of bilateral hands."

3. **HPI Spencer**: The HPI should summarize the history. The patient first noticed left hand issues many years ago, now affecting the right. The left hand can't lie flat, with significant contracture of the ring finger. On exam, left hand has 45-degree MP joint contracture and 10-degree PIP joint. Right hand has nodules but no contracture yet. X-rays are normal, but an MRI is needed.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's exam findings are: left upper extremity skin is cleaner, chordation and nodules, 45-degree MP joint contracture, 10-degree PIP joint. Right hand has nodules on long and ring fingers.

5. **Imaging Results**: X-rays are normal. MRI is recommended but not yet done, so imaging results are "X-rays normal."

6. **Assessment**: The conditions mentioned are bilateral hand contractures, nodules, and possible need for MRI. So, the assessment includes "Bilateral hand contractures," "Nodules on left and right hands," and "MRI recommended."

7. **Plan**: The plan is to recommend Zylex and return to clinic when medication is acquired.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly without adding any inferred information.
