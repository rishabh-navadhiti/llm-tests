Okay, so I need to process this medical transcript and fill out the JSON template provided. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient's name isn't mentioned anywhere in the conversation. The speaker is the doctor, and there are no other names mentioned, so I'll have to put a "-" for the patient name.

Next, the chief complaint. The doctor mentions that the patient presents for evaluation of contraction of his bilateral hands that began many years ago. So the chief complaint should be "Contraction of bilateral hands."

Moving on to the History of Present Illness (HPI). The patient is a dominant retiree with bilateral hand duodenal disease. He noticed the contraction starting on his left hand many years ago and now it's affecting his right hand. The left hand can't get flat on the table, and there's significant contracture of the leading finger. On exam, the left upper extremity shows significant cordation and nodules, with a 45-degree contracture at the ring finger MP joint and a 10-degree at the PIP joint. The right hand has nodules but no contracture yet. X-rays are normal, but an MRI is recommended.

For the Musculoskeletal section, I need to extract the physical exam findings verbatim. The doctor mentions significant cordation and nodules on the left hand with specific contractures, and on the right hand, nodules towards the long ring finger ray.

Imaging results: X-rays are normal, so I'll note that as "X-rays normal." An MRI is recommended but not yet performed, so I won't include that here.

Assessment should list active problems. From the transcript, these include bilateral hand contractures, left hand MP and PIP joint contractures, and nodular changes consistent with dense disease.

The plan includes recommending an MRI, prescribing Zylex, and following up when the medication is acquired.

I need to make sure each section is filled accurately without adding any inferred information. Also, ensure proper medical terminology and correct grammar throughout.
