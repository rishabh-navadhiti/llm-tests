Alright, I need to extract structured medical information from the provided transcript and populate the JSON template. Let me go through each field step by step.

1. **Patient Name**: The transcript doesn't mention the patient's full name explicitly. The doctor refers to her as "she" but doesn't provide a name. So, I'll use the default "-".

2. **Chief Complaint**: The patient presents with a right middle finger crush injury. The chief complaint is about this injury, so I'll state it as "Right middle finger crush injury."

3. **HPI Spencer**: I need to summarize the History of Present Illness. The injury started on 7-8-25 when her finger was crushed by a dumbbell. She experienced immediate pain, swelling, and limited motion. She went to urgent care, had X-rays showing a fracture, and was treated with a splint. Repeat X-rays after 4 weeks showed continued fracture, so she continued wearing the splint. Now, she's here for evaluation and treatment.

4. **Musculoskeletal Verbatim**: The doctor's physical exam findings include some hematoma, excellent flexion of the PIP, some DIP stiffness, no tenderness on palpation of the distal phalanx, and some paresthesia at the distal phalanx. I'll extract these verbatim.

5. **Imaging Results**: The transcript mentions X-rays showing a fracture of the distal phalanx with stable alignment and good fracture healing. So, I'll note that.

6. **Assessment**: The active problems are right middle finger crush injury and distal phalanx fracture.

7. **Plan**: The plan includes reple advanced activity (though "reple" might be a typo, but I'll keep it as is), avoiding hanging from hands, returning to the clinic in 3 weeks for a nail check before the wedding.

I need to ensure all fields are filled correctly without adding any inferred information. Let me double-check each section against the transcript to make sure I haven't missed anything or added extra details.
