# REC-6602

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Matches benchmark exactly with '-' as no patient name was provided in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Content matches benchmark meaning precisely (numbness and tingling in the right hand); minor wording ('increasing') aligns with transcript and is acceptable. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately captures chemo for lymphoma, increased right-hand numbness/tingling, thumb burn affecting tasks, and reduced phone use. Omits the minor detail that she has been at home more due to chemotherapy. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark contains '-', while candidate includes paraphrased exam details and not strict verbatim. Also includes 'PCGs are normal,' which is not clearly verbatim. Multiple deviations from benchmark expectations. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'X-ray is clear.' |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate lists 'numbness/tingling' and 'carpal tunnel syndrome,' which are not in the benchmark assessment (carpal tunnel only implied in plan). Misses several benchmark assessment items (skin intact, normal percussion of Guyon's canal, tenderness, ROM, nodule, trigger finger as a concise problem). Multiple omissions and one likely overreach. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Captures injection, night splints, low threshold for nerve studies, and 2-month follow-up. Minor omission of specifying 'right small finger' for the injection present in benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for most sections, especially chief complaint, imaging, and plan. HPI is strong with a minor omission. The main discrepancies are in the musculoskeletal verbatim field (non-verbatim content where benchmark is '-') and the assessment (missing exam-based items and adding 'carpal tunnel syndrome'). Overall, accurate but with notable deviations in assessment structure and verbatim requirements.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark and transcript: 'Nicole Coffee'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Conveys the same concise issue as the benchmark ('left index finger pain'); minor wording order only. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately includes duration, worsening, and request for injection, but omits the shoulder visit and Dr. Almadroa's observation context present in the benchmark/transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Faithfully reproduces the physician's exam wording (clean/dry skin, A1 polii tenderness, walking catching, triggering, excellent ROM, thumbs up). Minor casing and inclusion of 'et cetera' reflect the transcript. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | States that X-rays are normal, but omits the specifics 'three views' and 'left index finger' included in the benchmark/transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Lists left index finger pain and trigger pathology; 'triggering on index finger' is clinically equivalent to 'Trigger finger' but not exact phrasing. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Conveys plan for trigger finger injection today, consistent with the transcript. The benchmark's 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks' is not in the transcript, so omission is not penalized. |

**Total Score:** 32

**Percentage:** 91.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark with accurate patient identification, chief complaint, and verbatim musculoskeletal findings. HPI and imaging are slightly less detailed, and assessment/plan have minor wording differences, but overall fidelity to the transcript and clinical content is high.

| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | Candidate lists 'Gianna Saborio,' which pertains to a different patient segment. For this encounter, the name was not provided in the transcript; benchmark correctly uses '-'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | Includes correct complaint of left small finger locking/catching but adds 'tethering with finger flexion' from a different patient and is not concise. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Captures onset (~2 years) and prior surgery avoidance, but incorrectly states limiting ROM (contradicts 'excellent range of motion') and mixes in exam/imaging details. Not penalizing omission of job impact since that was not in transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Largely matches the exam findings, but not strictly verbatim (e.g., paraphrases 'A1 pulley' as 'trigger point' and minor wording changes). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Accurately reflects imaging: X-rays of the left small finger are normal. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Correctly lists trigger finger (left small finger) but adds 'Tethering post-surgery,' which applies to a different patient. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Includes planned trigger finger surgery but adds unrelated plan elements (gentle ROM, video visit in 1 month) and omits 'return in 2 weeks' from benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 17

**Percentage:** 48.57142857142857

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note partially captures the correct condition and imaging but repeatedly mixes content from a different patient encounter, leading to inaccuracies in the name, chief complaint, assessment, and plan. There is also a factual error about range of motion. Verbatim requirements for the musculoskeletal section were not fully met.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Both benchmark and candidate correctly use '-' as no patient name is provided in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Benchmark: 'Wrist pain.' Candidate adds 'significantly limiting activities,' which reflects the transcript but is slightly less concise than the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures knee replacement history, improved synovitis after injection, osteoporosis infusion, and interest in right total wrist arthroplasty. Omits the benchmark detail that the knee has recovered enough to start planning. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark is '-', reflecting no verbatim MSK exam statements. Candidate adds 'Bilateral wrist arthritis,' which is not a verbatim exam finding. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Benchmark specifies: 'Imaging mostly unchanged, except delete the large, poorly defined nodule.' Candidate has '-'. Missing stated imaging detail; note the transcript suggests imaging unchanged, so penalized modestly. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate includes synovitis and bilateral wrist arthritis (aligned) but omits osteoporosis and 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact,' and adds 'knee replacement status post' not listed in the benchmark assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Includes planning for right total wrist arthroplasty, but omits 'continue current infusion for osteoporosis' and 'return to clinic in 2 weeks'; adds a contingency about knee recovery not in the benchmark plan. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures key HPI elements and the chief complaint reasonably well but falls short on imaging, assessment, MSK verbatim requirements, and plan completeness. Several benchmark plan and assessment items are missing, and the MSK field is not verbatim.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Matches benchmark ('-'); the transcript provides no patient name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Candidate left this blank ('-') while benchmark lists 'Follow up for hand pain'. The chief complaint is not explicitly stated in the transcript (only implied), so penalized mildly for omission. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | Candidate is blank ('-') despite the transcript clearly stating that the prior injection gave no relief and the patient wants to know what's going on. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Accurately reflects the doctor’s verbatim findings (hypopigmentation at dorsal CMC consistent with prior injection; mild over first dorsal compartment; positive Finkelstein/finger stain; positive grind) with only trivial wording differences. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Matches benchmark ('-'); no imaging mentioned in the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Candidate left this blank, whereas the benchmark lists 'Pain in hand.' Assessment not explicitly stated in the transcript (though inferable), so partial credit with mild penalty. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark and transcript: recommend trial of de Quervain’s ('dig verban’s') injection and return to clinic in six weeks. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captured the musculoskeletal exam and plan but omitted key narrative elements, notably the HPI, chief complaint, and assessment. Where the benchmark included information not explicitly stated in the transcript (chief complaint, assessment), the candidate left fields blank. Overall, strong on exam and plan fidelity, weak on history and problem listing.

# REC-6610

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Includes the correct full name; the honorific 'Miss' is an inconsequential formatting addition and does not alter factual content. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Correctly identifies left wrist pain, but adds mechanism ('after a trip and fall'), making it less concise than the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately captures date, mechanism, initial improvement, urgent care X-rays with sprain diagnosis, and worsening in Massachusetts humidity. Minor omission of the explicit statement that this prompted the current visit. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark leaves this field blank ('-'), while the candidate includes exam phrases. Although transcript-based, it does not match the benchmark content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Captures that current left wrist X-rays are normal but omits the urgent care X-rays showing no fractures noted in the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes 'Left ECU tendonitis' and 'Left ulnar-sided wrist pain' as in the benchmark but omits other listed assessment items ('Skin is intact', 'No tenderness to palpation'). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Fully matches the benchmark plan: hand therapy trial, MRI for further evaluation, and return after MRI. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely aligns with key benchmark elements for name, HPI, assessment (core diagnoses), and plan. It over-specifies the chief complaint, omits part of the imaging history, and diverges from the benchmark by populating the musculoskeletal verbatim field. Overall, accurate and clinically coherent, with minor deviations from the benchmark content and formatting expectations.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'Left wrist pain and masses'; concise and accurate. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately summarizes pain worse than masses with nocturnal symptoms, two masses with precise locations, stability over time, and prior rheumatology imaging. Minor omission of the rheumatologist's name (Dr. Ishimori) present in benchmark/transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark contains '-', while candidate includes exam details. Although largely derived from the transcript, it does not match the benchmark's expected '-' and contains slight paraphrase/wording inconsistencies for a verbatim field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Fully aligns with benchmark: X-rays show MCP osteophyte; ultrasound shows bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte at dorsal MCP and a retinacular cyst superficial to the first dorsal compartment sheath. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes two correct active problems (left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst; left thumb MCP osteophyte) matching benchmark. Omits other benchmark items (some not clearly supported by the transcript) and adds vague 'Bilateral' which is unsupported; hence partial credit. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Captures night splints, observation of masses, and 6-week follow-up. Omits 'consider aspiration vs biopsy of the wrist mass' from benchmark. Adds 'for carpal tunnel'—consistent with transcript but extra relative to benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for patient name, chief complaint, and imaging, and provides a largely accurate HPI. The plan is mostly correct but misses the aspiration/biopsy consideration. Assessment includes key problems but adds an unsupported 'Bilateral' and misses other benchmark items. Musculoskeletal verbatim does not align with the benchmark's expected '-' despite reflecting transcript content.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Matches the benchmark precisely and is concise: 'Left wrist pain.' |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures all key elements (dominant hand, occupation, pain worse than masses, night symptoms, prior treatments, imaging, and goals). Minor omissions/wording differences: does not mention prior fluctuation of masses and specifies ultrasound of the wrist rather than 'anterior wrist.' |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark is '-', while the candidate includes a paraphrased exam and omits verbatim elements (e.g., negative Finkelstein, no pain with resisted thumb extension). Does not match the ground truth and is not verbatim. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Substantively consistent with the benchmark: osteophyte on X-ray; ultrasound shows bony avulsion fragment versus osteophyte at dorsal MCP and a retinacular cyst. Minor omissions include specifying 'thumb' MCP and 'superficial to the first dorsal compartment sheath.' |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes core problems (left first dorsal compartment cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte). Uses 'issues' instead of 'masses' and adds 'left wrist pain,' which is not in the benchmark list. Items in the benchmark not supported by the transcript (e.g., 'Right upper extremity skin is intact,' 'No tenderness to palpation') were not penalized. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Observation, aspiration/biopsy, and 6-week follow-up align with the benchmark. However, it attributes night splints to carpal tunnel, whereas the benchmark ties night splints to the masses. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for patient name, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging, with minor omissions. Assessment is partially aligned but includes wording differences and an extra item. The plan is mostly correct but misattributes the indication for night splints. The musculoskeletal verbatim section does not match the benchmark and is not verbatim.

**Total Score:** 31

**Percentage:** 88.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely aligns with the benchmark. Strengths include faithful musculoskeletal findings and an accurate plan. Minor shortcomings involve omission of left laterality, left-hand dominance/occupation in the HPI, and a slight wording deviation in imaging. Assessment is generally correct but less specific than the benchmark.

| PATIENT_NAME | 2 | Includes the correct patient name ('Chaz Thomas') but also lists four other patients; benchmark expects a single name for the encounter. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | Benchmark is a concise 'Follow-up'; candidate provides multiple complaints for different patients and adds detail, reducing concision and focus. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | For Chaz, it should note splint removal due to blood and that he wants to know what he can do; candidate mixes in multiple patients and includes exam elements (pain/limited flexion), and omits the patient's question. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Not verbatim: omits 'Excellent, thumbs up,' adds 'sutures removed,' and mixes findings from other patients; benchmark expects exact phrasing for Chaz. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | Benchmark is '-', as no imaging for Chaz is mentioned. Candidate adds 'MRI results reviewed' (pertains to a different patient and not stated as reviewed for Chaz). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark lists 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact. No tenderness to palpation.' (acknowledging these specifics are not in the transcript). Candidate instead lists different problems and aggregates other patients' issues. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Includes the correct plan for Chaz (transition to removable splint, hand therapy, 2-week follow-up) but also includes plans for other patients, reducing focus. |

**Total Score:** 11

**Percentage:** 31.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note frequently aggregates information across multiple patients instead of focusing on the single benchmark patient (Chaz Thomas). While the plan for Chaz matches well, most other fields contain extraneous content, lack verbatim accuracy, or deviate from the concise format expected. Imaging was incorrectly populated, and the HPI and musculoskeletal sections were not aligned with the benchmark requirements.

| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Candidate accurately summarizes thumb doing well with ongoing cycloprox use and recurrent middle finger locking/catching after prior injection relief. Minor omissions (e.g., explicit inquiry about continuing cycloprox) prevent a perfect match. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Field requires verbatim text. Benchmark states: 'Right upper extremity skin is cleaned and intact without erythemohymosis.' Candidate paraphrases ('clean' vs 'cleaned', 'erythema or hives' instead of 'erythemohymosis') and adds non-verbatim findings, making it largely non-verbatim and partially inaccurate. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly indicate '-' as no imaging is mentioned. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Candidate includes the key active problems: thumb pain (improved/resolved) and recurrent middle finger trigger symptoms, matching benchmark core items. Omission of 'skin intact' and 'no TTP' reduces alignment, though we do not penalize for benchmark elements that conflict with or are not supported by the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Plan aligns with benchmark: continue cycloprox, administer another middle finger injection, and activity as tolerated. Omission of 'RTC in 2 weeks' (present in benchmark but not in transcript) should not be penalized. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the main clinical content well, particularly HPI, assessment of active problems, imaging (none), and plan.

**Total Score:** 19

**Percentage:** 54.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures several key patient-reported symptoms and major plan items but misses the documented imaging entirely and does not provide verbatim musculoskeletal findings. The chief complaint is reasonable but differs from the benchmark. Assessment is partially aligned but omits 'skin intact.' Weight-bearing status is misstated in the plan. Overall, factual alignment is mixed with notable omissions and some misplacement of content.

# REC-6897

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Both notes correctly use '-' as no patient name is present in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | Benchmark shows '-', indicating no explicit chief complaint. Candidate assigns 'Ecchymosis' without it being stated as the chief complaint in the transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Captures all stated history: doing well overall, not much pain, and a lot of ecchymosis. Paraphrasing ('minimal pain', 'significant ecchymosis') preserves meaning without adding new information. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Transcript includes 'incision ... with varied sutures, moderate echinosis.' Candidate only included 'moderate echinosis,' omitting 'incision with varied sutures,' resulting in partial capture of the verbatim findings. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly indicate no imaging results ('-'); none are mentioned in the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Benchmark lists exam-based normal findings not present in the transcript (not penalized). Candidate lists 'Ecchymosis' (supported by transcript) and 'Carpal tunnel syndrome' (reasonable given 'post-op endocarpal tunnel' context, but not explicitly stated as a diagnosis). Partial alignment with transcript; differs from benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Transcript plan includes 'planned post-op endocarpal tunnel' and 'return to clinic in 4 weeks.' Candidate included only the follow-up, omitting the planned post-op item. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captured the HPI, patient name status, and absence of imaging, but fell short on chief complaint attribution, omitted part of the musculoskeletal verbatim exam, and provided an incomplete plan. The assessment included one transcript-supported item (ecchymosis) and a reasonable but not explicitly stated diagnosis.

# REC-6904

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'Jane Pollock'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | Benchmark chief complaint is 'Follow-up'. Candidate lists symptoms ('sore and stiff, but not too painful') rather than the visit reason. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Captures follow-up status, soreness/stiffness without significant pain, and bruising. Misses presence of husband and the patient's uncertainty about bruising. Adds exam details (incisions, finger positioning) which are factual but not part of HPI in the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Provides the physician’s verbatim MSK findings accurately. Omits the 'incisions dry and intact with sutures' line included in the benchmark (noted from the nurse), hence minor mismatch. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging mentioned in transcript; candidate correctly uses '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Benchmark includes 'Right upper extremity skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation' (the latter not stated in transcript, not penalized). Candidate lists postoperative state/ecchymosis/limited finger movement, which are clinically relevant but do not match benchmark assessment items. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Correctly includes return in 6 days and follow-up in one week for possible suture removal/initiation of therapy. However, 'remove soft dressings' conflicts with benchmark's implication that soft dressings are applied/kept, representing a substantive discrepancy. |

**Total Score:** 23

**Percentage:** 65.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly identifies the patient and absence of imaging, and captures key HPI and MSK findings, though it mixes exam details into the HPI. Chief complaint is incorrect, the assessment does not align with the benchmark, and the plan contains a notable error regarding dressings despite correct follow-up timing.

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match with benchmark ('Walt'); correctly derived from transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Candidate lists 'Numbness resolution' while benchmark uses 'Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.' Patient did ask about numbness, but benchmark frames the chief complaint as CTS; partial mismatch. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Includes PO1 status, minimal pain, and concern about numbness (aligned). However, it omits the 'busy day' detail and inappropriately adds exam finding ('moderate ecchymosis') into HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Very close to verbatim but simplifies/omits details ('joint type of variant sutures' and 'consistent with postoperative state'); minor wording differences. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Correctly marked as '-' consistent with benchmark indicating no imaging mentioned. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Captures post-op CTS status but lacks explicit 'release' wording used in benchmark; adds 'Residual numbness,' which is supported by transcript but not in benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark plan: post-op endoscopic carpal tunnel care and follow-up in 4 weeks. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note is generally accurate with correct patient name, imaging, and plan. Minor deviations include a different framing of the chief complaint, mixing exam findings into the HPI, and slight paraphrasing in the musculoskeletal verbatim section. Assessment is close to benchmark with an additional, supported item. Overall, a solid but not perfect match.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Captures the main issue (pain distal to the splint) but omits the 'follow-up' context present in the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Includes doing well, tolerating splint, pain distal to splint, hypersensitivity, and suspected nerve irritation from pressure. Minor omissions (follow-up context, 'increased' pain) and slight paraphrasing. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Close to verbatim but not exact; omits 'on the dorsal aspect,' includes ellipses, and slightly alters phrasing, which reduces fidelity to the dictated wording. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly document no imaging ('-'). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Captures hypersensitivity related to splint pressure and possible cutaneous nerve irritation, consistent with the transcript. Does not include 'skin intact' and 'no tenderness,' which appear in the benchmark but are not stated in the transcript, so not penalized. Minor wording differences from benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Accurately reflects the plan: modify splint, RTC Monday if no improvement, and RTC in 3 weeks. Minor wording differences do not change meaning. |

**Total Score:** 30

**Percentage:** 85.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark on most fields, accurately reflecting patient status, HPI details, and the plan. Minor gaps include omission of 'follow-up' context in the chief complaint/HPI, non-verbatim phrasing in musculoskeletal findings, and slight differences in assessment wording. No significant inaccuracies or hallucinations.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark ('Magara'). |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Content matches benchmark ('Bilateral hand numbness and tingling'); only capitalization differs. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Captures all key details from the benchmark (right-hand dominant retiree, onset Jan 2025, no trauma/injection, nocturnal symptoms improved by bracing, denies pain/limited motion). Minor wording differences do not change meaning. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark expects '-' (no verbatim provided). Candidate includes paraphrased exam text and introduces 'rash,' which is not verbatim from the transcript, leading to a major mismatch with the benchmark's content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Accurately reflects key imaging findings (right hand IP narrowing, most at thumb MCP; left hand severe CMC narrowing). Omits mention of variable narrowing on the left and '3 views' detail from the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes the main problems (carpal tunnel and peripheral neuropathy) but as 'features of' rather than definitive items. Omits benchmark’s included exam items ('Skin is intact', 'No tenderness to palpation'). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Matches core plan (nerve studies; follow-up, with 6–8 weeks aligning with transcript though benchmark lists 6 weeks). Adds 'Consideration for carpal tunnel treatment,' which is not in the benchmark, making it a minor deviation. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for patient name, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging. The assessment is partially aligned but less definitive and missing exam items included in the benchmark. The musculoskeletal verbatim field diverges notably, providing paraphrased/altered content when the benchmark has none. The plan aligns well with minor additions. Overall, good fidelity with a few deviations.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Matches benchmark with '-' since no name was provided in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Conveys 'trigger finger' accurately and with correct laterality/location; aligns with benchmark meaning. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes some correct elements (doing well with thumb, symptoms ~2020) but differs from benchmark (states recurrence vs benchmark 'new-onset'), omits that she hoped it wouldn’t progress and is asking next steps, and adds '3 injections were not effective' which is not explicitly stated in the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark is '-', while candidate paraphrases exam findings instead of providing verbatim text; does not match the benchmark content or the verbatim requirement. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both indicate no imaging findings ('-'). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Captures both problems but lacks specificity for the first item ('CMC arthritis' vs benchmark 'Right thumb CMC arthritis'). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Includes surgical release and risk discussion, but misses multiple benchmark elements: conservative management, context of 'after three injections,' carpal tunnel night splinting (stated as 'night lifting'), and CMC management (no injections today). Not penalizing for 'Return in 2 weeks' since that detail is not evident in the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly identified the chief complaint, absence of imaging, and most of the assessment, but the HPI deviates from the benchmark and adds an unsupported inference. The musculoskeletal section is not verbatim as required, and the plan omits several key details and contains an inaccuracy ('night lifting' vs 'night splinting'). Overall, partially accurate with notable gaps in HPI and plan fidelity.

| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately summarizes continued swelling with activity and hypersensitivity that improved over the last week. Omits the patient’s question about normalcy and the detail about the prior week duration. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Content matches the exam findings but is not strictly verbatim (removes fillers/‘On exam’ and changes 'one of the digit' to 'one of the digits'). Field requires verbatim phrasing. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Imaging not mentioned; both benchmark and candidate correctly list '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Includes 'Soft tissue swelling' but replaces 'decreased sensation in one digit (improving)' with 'Hypersensitivity improving,' which misstates the finding. Not penalized for omission of items not in transcript (skin intact, no TTP). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Plan matches benchmark: wean splint, advance activity and ROM, and follow-up in 3 months. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note aligns well with the benchmark for chief complaint, imaging, and plan, and provides a largely accurate HPI. The musculoskeletal section is accurate but not verbatim as required. The assessment contains a key mismatch by listing 'hypersensitivity improving' instead of 'decreased sensation in one digit (improving)'. Overall, good fidelity with some issues in verbatim requirement and assessment accuracy.

# REC-7067

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The transcript explicitly states the patient's name as 'Lindsay Demash,' which the benchmark includes. The candidate used '-' instead of the available name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Matches the benchmark in factual content (mass/bump at the ulnar border of the index finger DIP joint). Minor wording differences only. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Captures the core elements (new mass at ulnar DIP, different from arthritis bumps, not limiting, overall wrist improvement with some discomfort). Missing several benchmark details (turned a corner in May, lifting weights, shoulder symptoms). Laterality ('right') in benchmark likely derived from exam; not penalized if uncertain from transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Paraphrased and condensed; not verbatim. Omits multiple details present in the benchmark verbatim exam (skin intact, dorsal findings, DIP flexion degrees, incision healing, supination/pronation metrics, near full fist). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark indicate no imaging findings ('-'). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Includes 'mass at DIP joint' and 'arthritis' consistent with the benchmark. Missing items 'skin intact' and 'no tenderness to palpation.' Adds 'Heberden's nodes,' which are not listed in the benchmark assessment (minor addition). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark plan: continue home exercise program, advance activities, and return in 6 months. |

**Total Score:** 22

**Percentage:** 62.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captures the chief complaint, plan, and absence of imaging. It falls short on patient identification, provides a non-verbatim and incomplete musculoskeletal exam, and omits several HPI and assessment details included in the benchmark.

| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Findings are factually consistent (healing incision, minimal scar, excellent finger motion, flexion ~45, extension ~20) but not verbatim; wording altered (e.g., 'without painful post supination' changed to 'without pain, supination') and degrees added. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Includes core result (well-healed fracture with hardware) but omits details in benchmark/transcript such as 'post-op', 'stable hardware', and comments that plate alignment is good and reduction adequate. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes 'CRPS' (matches benchmark) but omits 'Status post left distal radius fracture' and adds 'Left wrist stiffness' which is not listed in the benchmark assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Captures most plan elements (advance activities; 3-month follow-up; discussion about limited push-ups; review X-rays) but omits explicit 'Return to Pilates' from the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 28

**Percentage:** 80

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for name, chief complaint, and HPI. Musculoskeletal findings are accurate but not verbatim as required. Imaging is correct but lacks several specific details. Assessment partially matches with one omission and one addition. Plan is largely aligned but misses the explicit 'Return to Pilates.' Overall, strong factual alignment with room for improvement in verbatim quoting and completeness.

| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately summarizes follow-up for possible suture removal and improved motion, consistent with transcript and benchmark. Includes an exam detail ('incision is clean and intact'), which is factual but not typically HPI content. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Not verbatim and omits several benchmark elements (incision status, sutures removed, patient tolerating well, full active extension, 'near tight fist'). Paraphrasing reduces fidelity to the required verbatim format. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark indicate no imaging reported ('-'). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Candidate lists conditions supported by the transcript (sutures in place, improving motion, post-op ecchymosis) but does not match benchmark items ('skin is intact', 'no tenderness'), which are not present in the transcript; not penalized for missing those, but content diverges from benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Correctly notes sutures removed today, aligning with benchmark. However, adds 'Follow-up in 4 weeks,' which conflicts with benchmark (2 weeks) and is not in the transcript; 'continue ROM' from benchmark is not in transcript and not required, but the incorrect interval lowers the score. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the patient name, general follow-up context, request for/act of suture removal, and some exam findings. Main deficiencies are lack of specificity in the chief complaint, non-verbatim and incomplete musculoskeletal section, divergence from benchmark assessment content, and an incorrect follow-up interval in the plan.

Adds 'minimally displaced fracture' not in the benchmark HPI and potentially misattributes it. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Benchmark indicates '-', but candidate includes non-verbatim and additional content; thus it does not match the benchmark requirement. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | States 'X-rays showed a fracture' but misses benchmark details that ER films showed a fracture and that a previous hand X-ray showed a minimally displaced small finger fracture. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes 'Fracture' and 'Lacerations' as in benchmark, but omits the benchmark item 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' and adds 'Left index finger crush injury' not listed in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Matches cast application, soft dressing under splint, antibiotics, and education about sand/infection. Misses explicit 'sweating' risk. Benchmark specifies 'return in 2 weeks' which is not in the transcript; no penalty applied for that omission. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Total Score:** 14

**Percentage:** 40

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note matches the benchmark on patient name and imaging, but diverges on chief complaint, HPI, assessment, and plan—likely drawing from a different segment of the transcript. Overall, it fails to align with the benchmark’s focus and key clinical details.

| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | Benchmark uses '-', while candidate lists 'James' (partial name, not full). This does not adhere to the instruction to use full name if explicitly mentioned or '-' otherwise. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Meaning matches the benchmark exactly: recurrence on the right and new triggering on the left. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Partially accurate (follow-up for bilateral trigger finger and inquiry about injection), but it conflates the surgical follow-up (James She) as the primary patient and omits key details from the benchmark (deferring right injection today and no prior injections on the left). Also adds exam details not summarized in the benchmark HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Content is similar but not verbatim. The benchmark states: 'Moderate soft tissue swelling, triggering of the middle finger. There is a nodule there that is triggering that.' Candidate paraphrases and omits phrasing, violating the verbatim requirement. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | Benchmark notes 'X-ray showed some fracture healing,' which is supported by the transcript. Candidate lists '-', missing the documented imaging finding. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Includes the core active problems matching the benchmark and transcript (right and left trigger finger, status post surgery). Omission of 'skin intact' and 'no tenderness to palpation' is not penalized as these specifics are not clearly supported by the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Captures major elements: defer right injection today, perform left injection, and follow-up with Dr. Hertz. Omits 'consider future injection if desired' and 'continue post-op protocol per Dr. Hertz' present in the benchmark/transcript. The benchmark's 'RTC in 4 weeks' is not in the transcript and is not penalized. |

**Total Score:** 20

**Percentage:** 57.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the chief complaint and core assessment well, but the HPI conflates patients and misses key details, the musculoskeletal section is not verbatim, and imaging results are omitted despite being documented.

| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark is '-', while candidate provides paraphrased MSK findings and not verbatim quotes. This does not match the benchmark and does not follow the 'verbatim' instruction, though the content is related. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | Benchmark specifies: right wrist—ulna callus; left wrist—diffuse radius and ulna callus. Candidate merges these without laterality ('ulna and radius'), losing specificity and partially misstating the right side. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark assessment includes 'Right upper extremity skin is intact,' 'Trigger finger (right index and middle),' and 'No TTP.' Candidate lists neck pain and cast-related issues, omitting trigger finger and the benchmark exam qualifiers. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Candidate includes cast transition on the left, weaning the right, and considering a removable splint—matching parts of the benchmark. However, it omits the injection for trigger fingers, adds 'follow-up in one year for Kabe' (not in benchmark), and gives '4 weeks' instead of '6 weeks' (note: transcript did not provide the exact number; candidate introduced an incorrect value). |

**Total Score:** 13
