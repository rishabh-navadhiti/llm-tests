      "The patient is a right\u2011hand dominant horticulturalist who sustained a trip and fall on 6/21/25 while leaving Groundlings, resulting in left wrist pain. The pain was present immediately after the fall, was painful then, and began to improve slightly. She obtained urgent\u2011care X\u2011rays that showed no fractures and was diagnosed with a sprain. Subsequent exposure to humidity in Massachusetts increased her pain, prompting evaluation today."
