      "The patient, Mahika Mahendru, presents for follow\u2011up and reports overall doing well and tolerating her splint without complaint except for pain around the joint distal to the splint, which is described as markedly hypersensitive. On examination the splint is in place with mild soft\u2011tissue swelling and significant hypersensitivity distal to the splint; the splint exerts a fair amount of pressure on the dorsal aspect of the right hand. The extensor tendons cannot be subluxated while the splint is on, and she demonstrates excellent PAP within the splint. The increased pain is attributed to irritation of a cutaneous nerve from splint pressure."
