She states the lesion does not limit movement but is concerned because it differs from the typical arthritic bumps she usually experiences. She reports no pain associated with the mass. She also notes overall improvement in wrist function, being able to lift weights and perform activities with less pain, although she continues to have occasional aches in the wrist and shoulder."
