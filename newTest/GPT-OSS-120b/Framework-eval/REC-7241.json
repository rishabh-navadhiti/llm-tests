      "The patient presents for follow\u2011up with his wife reporting a recurrence of trigger finger on the right side and new triggering of the left middle finger. He inquires whether it is too soon for another injection. On examination, there is moderate soft\u2011tissue swelling of both hands with triggering of the middle finger and a palpable nodule that is causing the trigger. He wishes to defer injection on the right side today and is agreeable to receiving an injection on the left side, where he has not had prior injections. The patient also notes prior surgery with Dr. Hertz and asks how the exam findings appear."
