      "She sustained a crush injury to her right middle finger by a dumbbell on 7-8-25 with immediate pain, swelling, and limited motion. She obtained urgent care x\u2011rays that demonstrated a fracture and was treated with a splint. Repeat x\u2011rays four weeks later showed a continued fracture, so she remained in the splint and presents today for evaluation. On exam she has a hematoma, excellent PIP flexion, DIP stiffness, no tenderness over the distal phalanx, and paresthesia at the distal phalanx. Imaging now shows a fracture of the distal phalanx with stable alignment and good healing."
