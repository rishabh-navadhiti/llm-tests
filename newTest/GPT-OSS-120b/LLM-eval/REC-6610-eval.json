      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Candidate provides accurate verbatim MSK exam from the transcript, whereas the benchmark left this field as '-'. Minor discrepancy due to benchmark omission, not factual error."

Minor differences include adding verbatim MSK findings (omitted in the benchmark), omitting two minor assessment lines, and including one extra plan phrase. Overall, factual alignment is strong."
