    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Accurately summarizes the HPI: follow-up visit, reports no pain, wants to know what is going on; no added or omitted details."

      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Verbatim extraction of the exam findings as dictated, matching the benchmark content in meaning and phrasing from the transcript."

      "justification": "Includes all plan elements as dictated: continue splint, review X-rays, return in 10 days with likely pin removal or repeat X-rays, transition to phenylplastic splint, and referral to Eliza Cherian; minor filler words do not alter content."

  "total_score": 31,
  "percentage": 88.57,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark across most fields, especially name, chief complaint, HPI, musculoskeletal exam, imaging, and plan. The primary discrepancy is in the Assessment, where the candidate listed 'stiff fingers' instead of the benchmark's normal findings, leading to a significant mismatch. Overall, strong performance with one notable deviation."
