    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The transcript clearly states the patient's name as 'Nadeem Nemi,' but the candidate returned '-'. Major omission."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Matches the benchmark 'Bilateral thumb pain' in content; minor casing difference only."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Accurately summarizes worsening bilateral thumb pain since 2019, worse in last 6 months, denies numbness/tingling, and reports limitation; includes stated history and improvement of carpal/cubital tunnel as in transcript."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Verbatim extraction of exam findings from the transcript. Benchmark listed '-', but transcript clearly contains these findings."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Captures key right-hand findings, but incorrectly states 'The left is the same,' implying calcific arteriogram on the left; benchmark and transcript indicate the left is the same except without the calcific arteriogram."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Includes main active problems (bilateral thumb CMC arthritis, right cubital tunnel syndrome, carpal tunnel), and symptom of thumb pain. Missing 'bilateral' qualifier for carpal tunnel compared to transcript/benchmark."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Plan matches the transcript and benchmark: trial of injections with counseling on temporary effect/rebound pain; observation for carpal/cubital tunnel with consideration of nerve studies; RTC in 2 months."

  "total_score": 28,
  "percentage": 80.0,
  "overall_summary": "Strong overall note with accurate chief complaint, HPI, musculoskeletal exam (verbatim), and plan. Main deficiencies: omitted patient name despite being stated, and imaging misrepresented the left hand as identical to the right by not excluding calcific arteriogram; minor lack of laterality for carpal tunnel in assessment."
