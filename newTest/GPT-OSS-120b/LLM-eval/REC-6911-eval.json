  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely aligns with the benchmark in most sections, particularly name, exam, imaging, assessment, and plan. The main discrepancies are in the chief complaint (symptom vs diagnosis) and HPI, which misses some details and adds a mildly speculative element. Overall, solid performance with minor content and wording differences."
