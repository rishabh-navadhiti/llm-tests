      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Includes objective exam details (splint status, swelling, tendon subluxation, PAP) which should not be in HPI and are not in the benchmark HPI; also adds 'right hand,' which is not explicitly stated in the transcript. History elements otherwise align."

    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Contains the key dictated phrases and is mostly verbatim, but omits 'on the dorsal aspect' and minor phrasing present in the benchmark."

    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Includes 'hypersensitivity distal to splint' (matches benchmark) and adds pain and presumed cutaneous nerve irritation supported by the transcript. Benchmark also lists normal findings not present in the transcript; not penalized for their absence."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark in patient identification, plan, imaging, and captures the chief complaint and MSK findings with minor omissions. The main deficit is in the HPI, which incorrectly includes exam details and a slight location inference not explicit in the transcript. Assessment aligns with key issues, with acceptable additions supported by the transcript."
