      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Fully aligns with benchmark in all factual elements: right-hand dominant retiree, onset around Jan 2025, no trauma/injection, nocturnal symptoms improved with braces, denies pain/limited motion."

      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Benchmark shows '-' (no content), while candidate included a long verbatim block mixing exam and imaging text, which does not match the benchmark output."

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Candidate includes 'Carpal tunnel syndrome' and 'peripheral neuropathy' (with added 'medication-induced' qualifier) but adds multiple non-benchmark items (symptom and imaging-based findings) and omits benchmark items ('skin intact', 'no TTP'). Multiple discrepancies."

  "total_score": 27,
  "percentage": 77.14,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for patient name, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging results. The plan is largely consistent aside from the follow-up interval. Major divergence occurs in the musculoskeletal verbatim field (candidate populated while the benchmark is blank) and the assessment (candidate adds non-benchmark items and modifies phrasing). Overall, strong on core history and imaging, but weaker alignment on exam/assessment formatting and content."
