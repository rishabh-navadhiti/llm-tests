      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Includes key problems (soft tissue swelling, decreased digit sensation) and adds slight extension lag from transcript (reasonable). Omits benchmark items ('skin is intact', 'no TTP') that are not in the transcript (no penalty for those omissions). Minor detail difference (did not note 'improving' for sensation)."

  "overall_summary": "Excellent alignment with the benchmark across most fields, with accurate transcript-based content. The only minor deviation is in the Assessment, which omits benchmark-only items not present in the transcript and adds a relevant, accurate finding from the exam."
