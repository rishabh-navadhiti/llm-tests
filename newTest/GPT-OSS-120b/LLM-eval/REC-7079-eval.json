      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Includes correct elements (post-op follow-up, improving motion, asking about suture removal) but adds multiple exam findings (clean incision, ROM, no triggering, ecchymosis) that belong in the physical exam, not HPI."

      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Captures the doctorâ€™s dictated findings essentially verbatim (suture removal, intact incision, near tight fist without pain, full extension, no triggering, moderate ecchymosis). Minor ordering/punctuation differences do not change factual content."

      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Contains inaccuracies: 'Sutures pending removal' contradicts 'sutures removed today'; 'Reduced range of motion' contradicts excellent ROM; 'ecchymosis of finger' is not specified (doctor says 'form/forearm'). Not penalized for missing benchmark items that are not in transcript."

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Transcript indicates sutures were removed today (a plan/procedure), but candidate returns '-' with no plan. Not penalized for missing benchmark items not stated in the transcript (ROM exercises, 2-week follow-up)."
