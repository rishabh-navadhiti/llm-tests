  "overall_summary": "The candidate note captures several core elements, including the HPI improvement details and imaging deferral, and largely aligns with the plan. However, it misses the chief complaint, diverges from the benchmark in the musculoskeletal verbatim section, and the assessment includes additions and omissions relative to the benchmark. Overall, moderate alignment with notable discrepancies."
