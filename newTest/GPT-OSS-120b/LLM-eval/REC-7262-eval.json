  "overall_summary": "The candidate note matches the patient name and imaging well and largely captures the plan. However, it only partially reflects the chief complaint, includes objective findings in the HPI while omitting key HPI details, diverges from the benchmark in the musculoskeletal verbatim section, and the assessment only partially aligns. Overall, it shows moderate fidelity with notable deviations in structure and content adherence."
