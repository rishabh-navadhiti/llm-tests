      "She suffered a left distal radius fracture in October 2023 after a fall, was treated surgically by Dr. Andrew Rice and diagnosed with CRPS. Since the injury she has persistent stiffness of the left wrist and limited extension, reporting she cannot extend enough to perform a push‑up despite making progress. She continues regular Pilates without pain or limitation, but the inability to fully extend the wrist remains. On examination she has minimal scar, excellent finger motion, wrist flexion about 45°, extension about 20°, and X‑ray shows a well‑healed fracture with hardware."
