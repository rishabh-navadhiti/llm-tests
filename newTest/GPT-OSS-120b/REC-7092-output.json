He presented to the emergency department where X‑rays confirmed a fracture and he received irrigation and interrupted sutures for two dorsal lacerations along the ulnar border and second web space. He reports limited flexion and extension of the middle finger but is able to actively flex. He is currently using a cast and soft dressing."
