# REC-6602

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Both benchmark and candidate correctly return '-' as no patient name is provided in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Candidate 'right hand numbness and tingling' matches the benchmark 'Numbness and tingling in the right hand' in meaning and concision. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Candidate includes all benchmark elements (right hand numbness/tingling, burned right thumb with functional difficulty, holding phone less, recent chemotherapy for lymphoma and being at home more) with clear, accurate wording. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark is '-', while the candidate provides verbatim exam findings from the transcript (including X-ray mention). Although accurate to the transcript, it does not match the benchmark content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'X-ray is clear.' |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate includes 'right small finger trigger' (aligns) and symptom items, but omits multiple benchmark items (skin intact, normal percussion of Guyon's canal, moderate tenderness, excellent ROM, nodule). It also adds 'burned right thumb with sensory deficit' which is not in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Core plan elements match the benchmark (trigger finger injection today, night splints for carpal tunnel, low threshold for nerve studies, RTC in 2 months). Minor differences include extra historical detail (last injection 2015) and verbatim phrasing; overall meaning preserved. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note aligns well with the benchmark for patient name, chief complaint, HPI, imaging, and largely for the plan. The main discrepancies are in the musculoskeletal verbatim field (candidate provided detailed transcript content whereas the benchmark is empty) and the assessment, where several benchmark items are missing and one symptom-based item is added. Overall, strong factual accuracy with mismatches in two sections relative to the benchmark.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark and explicitly stated in the transcript ('Nicole Coffee'). |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Conveys the same issue as the benchmark ('Left index finger pain') with minor wording differences only. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Includes all key facts from the benchmark: duration (few months), context (shoulder appointment with observation), worsening, and request for injection; no extraneous info. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Contains the same exam findings as the benchmark, preserving factual content; added filler words do not change meaning. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Communicates that three-view finger X-rays are normal, matching the benchmark’s findings. Laterality detail in the benchmark is not explicit in the transcript, so not penalized. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Lists 'left index finger pain' and 'trigger finger,' consistent with the benchmark; added laterality is acceptable. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | Conflicts with the benchmark by stating 'not having the injection' versus benchmark plan for trigger finger injection. Omission of 'RTC in 2 weeks' is not penalized as it is not in the transcript, but the core treatment plan is incorrect. |

**Total Score:** 31

**Percentage:** 88.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark across most fields, accurately reflecting the patient’s identity, chief complaint, HPI, exam, imaging, and assessment. The primary deficiency is in the Plan, which contradicts the benchmark’s injection plan. Otherwise, differences are minor and largely stylistic.

# REC-6605

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | Benchmark uses '-' (no name provided for this encounter). Candidate lists 'Gianna Saborio', which is a different patient mentioned later in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | Benchmark: 'Left small finger locking and catching.' Candidate: 'tethering with flexion of fingers,' which refers to a different patient. Major mismatch of the main issue. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Accurately summarizes the transcript for the intended patient: right-hand dominant designer, left small finger locking/catching for ~2 years, delayed care due to prior trigger finger surgeries, now seeking treatment. The benchmark mentions job impact not explicitly stated in the transcript; not penalized. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Candidate reproduces the dictated exam essentially verbatim (no erythema, moderate TTP at A1 pulley, palpable nodule, excellent ROM, well-healed middle finger incisions). Minor wording/ASR artifact differences from the benchmark phrasing. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both indicate normal X-rays. Candidate's 'X-rays are normal' matches the benchmark's factual content. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Includes the correct diagnosis 'left small finger trigger finger' but adds 'tethering of fingers,' which pertains to another patient, introducing an extraneous problem. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | Benchmark: planned trigger finger release and return in 2 weeks. Candidate mixes in another patient's postoperative plan (sutures removed, gentle ROM, video visit in 1 month), with only a vague 'planned trigger.' Mostly incorrect. Note: the benchmark's 2-week follow-up is not explicitly in the transcript, but the primary error is mixing plans from different patients. |

**Total Score:** 18

**Percentage:** 51.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note mixes details from two different patients, leading to incorrect patient name, chief complaint, assessment, and plan. HPI, musculoskeletal findings, and imaging largely align with the intended patient, though exam text differs slightly in wording. Overall accuracy is moderate due to cross-patient contamination.

| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark has '-', while candidate included a line that pertains to imaging/note edits, not MSK exam. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | Benchmark states 'Imaging mostly unchanged, except delete the large, poorly defined nodule,' which is supported by the transcript; candidate returned '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes osteoporosis and bilateral wrist arthritis and wrist pain, but omits 'Synovitis' from benchmark/transcript. Not penalized for excluding 'skin is intact' since that normal finding is not in the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Includes core plan to pursue right total wrist arthroplasty and planning. Lacks 'continue infusion' and 'RTC 2 weeks' from benchmark (not in transcript) and includes exam/imaging note-edit lines in the plan. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** Strong alignment on patient name, chief complaint, and HPI. Main deficiencies are misplacement/omission of imaging and MSK content, omission of synovitis in the assessment, and inclusion of non-plan elements in the plan. Core treatment plan is captured.

| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes key problems matching the benchmark (left wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte) and adds the thumb MCP mass from the transcript. Uses 'left wrist pain' vs benchmark 'bilateral hand pain' (the latter not clearly supported in the transcript). Omits normal findings present in the benchmark; not penalized as they are not active problems. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Captures all plan elements from the benchmark (night splints, observe masses, aspiration vs biopsy, return in 6 weeks) and includes 'plan carpal tunnel' as dictated in the transcript; benchmark omission not penalized. |

**Total Score:** 32

**Percentage:** 91.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely aligns with the benchmark and transcript, with accurate HPI, verbatim MSK exam, precise imaging, and a comprehensive plan.

**Percentage:** 65.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the chief complaint and most of the HPI and plan accurately, with minor overreach by including plan details in the HPI. The musculoskeletal section is largely verbatim but differs from the benchmark in laterality. Imaging misses the calcific arteriogram detail present in the benchmark, likely due to the subsequent instruction to delete it. Assessment includes all key diagnoses but omits a normal finding included in the benchmark. The major miss is the patient name, which is present in the transcript but not captured.

| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Candidate includes verbatim phrases ('skin is cleaned and intact' and limited small finger motion) from the exam. Benchmark only lists 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' Minor wording and extra included content, but core finding matches. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Candidate reflects the transcript verbatim ('4 views... stable... minimal fracture healing'). Benchmark paraphrases to 'Four view X-ray... extraarticular stable fracture with minimal healing.' Minor wording differences; meaning preserved. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Benchmark lists 'Skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation.' Candidate lists 'Right small finger motion limitation' and 'Minimal fracture healing,' which do not match benchmark assessment items. Note: 'No tenderness to palpation' is not in the transcript and is not penalized for being absent, but the candidate’s items still diverge from the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Candidate captures all key plan elements (continue ulnar gutter splint, down weight-bearing, splint change, transition to thermoplastic splint, therapy prescription, RTC in 3 weeks) consistent with benchmark. Some phrasing is garbled ('clip,' 'honors'), so minor wording issues. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note matches the benchmark well for name, HPI content, musculoskeletal findings, imaging, and plan, albeit with minor wording and formatting issues. Chief complaint and assessment diverge notably from the benchmark, lowering the overall score.

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly use '-' since no patient name is stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Both notes list '-' and the transcript does not provide a clear chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Core facts match (doing well, little pain, lots of ecchymosis), but the candidate adds exam details (incision, sutures, bruising), infers postoperative follow-up wording, and adds 'No other new symptoms,' which is not stated. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Transcript includes 'Incision with varied sutures, moderate ecchymosis,' but the candidate left this field empty instead of providing verbatim text. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly indicate no imaging results with '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Candidate lists 'Carpal tunnel postoperative' and 'Ecchymosis,' which are supported by the transcript. Benchmark contains items not present in the transcript; per instructions, not penalized. Minor mismatch with benchmark content prevents a perfect score. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Accurately captures the plan: planned post-op endocarpal tunnel and return in 4 weeks; minor filler words do not change meaning. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.28571428571429

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly handled name, chief complaint, imaging, and plan. HPI included inappropriate exam details and an unstated negative. Musculoskeletal verbatim was omitted despite clear transcript content. Assessment was reasonable and transcript-based but did not match the benchmark items.

# REC-6904

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to transcript: 'Jane Pollock' explicitly stated. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | Benchmark chief complaint is 'Follow-up'; candidate provides 'Sore and stiff'. While symptoms are mentioned in the transcript, the primary visit reason (follow-up) is missing. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes exam findings (ecchymosis, finger positions, 4 cm from palm) and laterality not stated by patient, and omits key HPI elements in benchmark (follow-up, overall doing well, husband present, uncertainty if bruising is normal). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Largely matches the doctor’s dictated MSK findings verbatim but omits the benchmark’s initial sentence about incisions being dry/intact with sutures and has minor wording differences. Note: that omitted line was spoken by the nurse in the transcript. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging mentioned in the transcript; candidate correctly returns '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate lists problem findings (soreness, ecchymosis, limited motion) whereas benchmark lists normal findings ('skin intact', 'no tenderness'). Substantial mismatch with benchmark content. Not penalized for missing benchmark-only details not present in transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Captures key plan elements: soft dressing, return in 6 days and in one week to consider suture removal and initiation of therapy. Minor wording/clarity issues ('drive') but overall content aligns with benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly identifies the patient and imaging status and captures most of the MSK exam and plan content. Major shortcomings include using symptoms instead of the visit reason for the chief complaint, an HPI that improperly incorporates exam details while omitting key contextual elements, and an assessment that diverges notably from the benchmark’s content.

# REC-6911

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark ('Walt'); correctly extracted from transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Candidate lists 'Numbness' while benchmark lists 'Carpal Tunnel Syndrome'. Related but not the same main complaint stated by the doctor. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Captures minimal pain and concern about numbness, consistent with transcript. Omits 'busy day' and occupation detail present in benchmark; additionally introduces 'underwent carpal tunnel release,' which is not in the benchmark HPI (though postoperative context is implied elsewhere). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Factual content matches benchmark findings; minor wording/filler ('On exam', 'um') and punctuation differences. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly indicate no imaging results ('-'). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Conveys status post carpal tunnel release (worded as 'Carpal tunnel postoperative') and adds 'Persistent numbness,' a relevant active symptom; aligns with benchmark without contradiction. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark plan: planned post-op endoscopic carpal tunnel and return in 4 weeks; only minor wording differences. |

**Total Score:** 30

**Percentage:** 85.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely aligns with the benchmark in most sections, particularly name, exam, imaging, assessment, and plan. The main discrepancies are in the chief complaint (symptom vs diagnosis) and HPI, which misses some details and adds a mildly speculative element. Overall, solid performance with minor content and wording differences.

# REC-6922

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to the transcript and benchmark ('Mahika Mahendru'). |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Captures the main issue (pain distal to splint) but omits the 'follow-up' context present in the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes objective exam details (splint status, swelling, tendon subluxation, PAP) which should not be in HPI and are not in the benchmark HPI; also adds 'right hand,' which is not explicitly stated in the transcript. History elements otherwise align. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Contains the key dictated phrases and is mostly verbatim, but omits 'on the dorsal aspect' and minor phrasing present in the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging mentioned; '-' matches the benchmark and transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes 'hypersensitivity distal to splint' (matches benchmark) and adds pain and presumed cutaneous nerve irritation supported by the transcript. Benchmark also lists normal findings not present in the transcript; not penalized for their absence. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Accurately reflects the plan: modify splint; return Monday if no improvement; return in 3 weeks. Matches benchmark content. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark in patient identification, plan, imaging, and captures the chief complaint and MSK findings with minor omissions. The main deficit is in the HPI, which incorrectly includes exam details and a slight location inference not explicit in the transcript. Assessment aligns with key issues, with acceptable additions supported by the transcript.

# REC-7051

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match with benchmark ('Magara'); name appears explicitly in transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Content matches benchmark ('Bilateral hand numbness and tingling'); only casing differs, which is acceptable. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Fully aligns with benchmark in all factual elements: right-hand dominant retiree, onset around Jan 2025, no trauma/injection, nocturnal symptoms improved with braces, denies pain/limited motion. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark shows '-' (no content), while candidate included a long verbatim block mixing exam and imaging text, which does not match the benchmark output. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Matches benchmark findings: right hand IP joint space narrowing, most notable at thumb MCP, and left hand with severe CMC narrowing; minor wording differences only. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate includes 'Carpal tunnel syndrome' and 'peripheral neuropathy' (with added 'medication-induced' qualifier) but adds multiple non-benchmark items (symptom and imaging-based findings) and omits benchmark items ('skin intact', 'no TTP'). Multiple discrepancies. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Consistent with benchmark on nerve studies and follow-up, but candidate lists '6 to 8 weeks' vs benchmark '6 weeks'. Otherwise aligned. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for patient name, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging results. The plan is largely consistent aside from the follow-up interval. Major divergence occurs in the musculoskeletal verbatim field (candidate populated while the benchmark is blank) and the assessment (candidate adds non-benchmark items and modifies phrasing). Overall, strong on core history and imaging, but weaker alignment on exam/assessment formatting and content.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Matches benchmark exactly with '-' since no name is stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Conveys the same complaint as the benchmark ('trigger finger') with appropriate specificity ('right ring finger'). |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Overall aligns with benchmark (follow-up, thumb CMC arthritis controlled, recurrent right ring trigger, seeking next steps). However, it adds an overly specific onset date ('2/5/2020') not supported by the transcript (benchmark uses 'around 2020'), making a factual detail incorrect. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark is '-' (no accepted MSK verbatim). Candidate includes exam-like text that appears in the transcript but is spoken by the patient, not the doctor, and includes some garbled phrasing. This does not match the benchmark content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Matches benchmark '-' with no imaging mentioned in the transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Lists the same active problems as the benchmark (CMC arthritis and right ring trigger finger). The added 'recurrent' is consistent with 'came back.' Note: Benchmark specifies 'Right thumb'; the transcript does not clearly state laterality for the thumb, so not penalized. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Captures key plan elements aligned with the benchmark: defer injections, conservative management, surgical release after three injections with risks discussed, and continue night support for carpal tunnel. Minor discrepancy with 'night lifting' vs benchmark 'night splinting.' The benchmark includes 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks,' which is not stated in the transcript; not penalized for omission. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.85714285714286

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely aligns with the benchmark on most fields, correctly identifying the chief complaint, assessment, and lack of imaging. The HPI contains one incorrect specific date. The musculoskeletal field diverges from the benchmark by including patient-spoken exam text. The plan is largely consistent with minor wording differences and omits a follow-up time only present in the benchmark.

| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging mentioned; '-' matches benchmark intent. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes key problems (soft tissue swelling, decreased digit sensation) and adds slight extension lag from transcript (reasonable). Omits benchmark items ('skin is intact', 'no TTP') that are not in the transcript (no penalty for those omissions). Minor detail difference (did not note 'improving' for sensation). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches plan: wean splint, advance activity, advance ROM, and return in 3 months; phrasing/formatting differences only. |

**Total Score:** 34

**Percentage:** 97.14

**Overall Summary:** Excellent alignment with the benchmark across most fields, with accurate transcript-based content. The only minor deviation is in the Assessment, which omits benchmark-only items not present in the transcript and adds a relevant, accurate finding from the exam.

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The patient's name 'Lindsay Demash' is explicitly stated in the transcript, but the candidate returned '-'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Concise and matches the benchmark content about a mass/new bump at the ulnar border of the index finger DIP joint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes core details (new mass at ulnar border, concern, not limiting, wrist/shoulder symptoms) but adds an unsupported statement ('no pain associated with the mass') and omits multiple details from the benchmark (e.g., 'turned a corner in May,' 'clicks,' and laterality). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Contains several verbatim MSK phrases (ROM, incision healing, supination/pronation, fist) but omits multiple dictated elements present in the benchmark such as 'Right upper extremity is clean,' Heberden nodes, mass location, and osteophyte. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging findings are mentioned in the transcript; both candidate and benchmark correctly list '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes key problems (mass, osteoarthritis) and adds symptom-based items (wrist/shoulder aches) supported by the transcript. It omits benchmark items that are exam findings (e.g., skin intact), leading to minor differences from the benchmark list. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Accurately captures the dictated plan: continue home exercise program, continue advancing activity, and return in 6 months. |

**Total Score:** 23

**Percentage:** 65.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the chief complaint, imaging status, and plan accurately. HPI contains one unsupported statement and misses several details. Musculoskeletal verbatim content is only partially captured, omitting key dictated elements. Assessment aligns on major issues with some acceptable additions, but differs slightly from the benchmark list. Patient name extraction was missed.

# REC-7074

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | Benchmark lists 'Math' from the transcript, but the candidate returned '-'. The patient's name is explicitly stated, so the candidate is incorrect. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Candidate states 'stiffness that has persisted since her wrist injury' which captures the gist but omits side and location ('left wrist') present in the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Includes key facts (left distal radius fracture in Oct 2023 after a fall, surgery by Dr. Rice, CRPS, persistent stiffness, cannot do push-up, Pilates without pain). However, it inappropriately adds exam and imaging details, which the benchmark excludes per instructions. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Nearly verbatim to the transcript; minor wording difference ('while' vs 'well') compared to the benchmark but the factual content matches. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Captures the main findings (well-healed fracture, stable hardware, plate alignment good, reduction adequate) but omits explicit mention of modality/side ('X-ray of the left wrist, post-op') and uses abbreviated phrasing. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Contains benchmark items (CRPS, status post left distal radius fracture) and adds relevant symptom-based problems (left wrist stiffness, limited extension) consistent with the transcript. Minor differences in phrasing. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Includes 'not limit her'/advance activity and 3-month follow-up, aligning with the benchmark, but misses/garbles 'Return to Pilates' and includes extraneous imaging review text. Overall partially matches plan content. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures many core facts but has notable issues: missing the explicitly stated patient name, a less specific chief complaint, inclusion of exam/imaging in the HPI, and a partially incorrect/garbled plan that omits 'Return to Pilates.' Musculoskeletal and imaging content are largely consistent with the benchmark, though imaging lacks modality/side detail. Overall, moderate fidelity with room for improvement in precision and adherence to instructions.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to transcript: 'Bertha Campos' is explicitly stated. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Candidate lists 'follow-up' only, missing the key detail of suture removal inquiry present in the benchmark and transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes correct elements (post-op follow-up, improving motion, asking about suture removal) but adds multiple exam findings (clean incision, ROM, no triggering, ecchymosis) that belong in the physical exam, not HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Captures the doctor’s dictated findings essentially verbatim (suture removal, intact incision, near tight fist without pain, full extension, no triggering, moderate ecchymosis). Minor ordering/punctuation differences do not change factual content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging mentioned in the transcript; both candidate and benchmark correctly return '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Contains inaccuracies: 'Sutures pending removal' contradicts 'sutures removed today'; 'Reduced range of motion' contradicts excellent ROM; 'ecchymosis of finger' is not specified (doctor says 'form/forearm'). Not penalized for missing benchmark items that are not in transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Transcript indicates sutures were removed today (a plan/procedure), but candidate returns '-' with no plan. Not penalized for missing benchmark items not stated in the transcript (ROM exercises, 2-week follow-up). |

**Total Score:** 23

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Content matches the benchmark ('Left index finger injury'); only capitalization differs, which is harmless. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate includes inaccuracies and inferences not supported by the transcript (adds '22-year-old', interprets '8:15, 25' as a time rather than date, states 'currently using a cast and soft dressing'). While it captures pain with motion, lack of deformity, ER X-rays showing fracture, lacerations with sutures, and limited middle finger motion, the added/incorrect details reduce fidelity. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark has '-' while candidate supplies mixed, partially verbatim exam statements and a fragmented imaging line. Content is not aligned to the benchmark and is not strictly doctor-only verbatim. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Candidate captures that ER X-rays showed a fracture but omits the benchmark’s additional detail that a previous hand X-ray demonstrated a minimally displaced fracture in the small finger. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Candidate lists fracture and lacerations consistent with benchmark, but omits 'skin is intact' and adds 'limited flexion of middle finger' (not in benchmark). Note: do not penalize for benchmark elements absent from transcript; however, the mismatch vs. benchmark content warrants a moderate score. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Candidate includes key plan elements: fracture cast, protect lacerations with soft dressing under splint, Burning Man-related infection risk counseling, antibiotics for a few more days, and RTC when they return. Benchmark specifies 'return in 2 weeks' (not stated in transcript, so not penalized). Minor noise ('age 22') and garbled phrases prevent a perfect score. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captures the chief complaint and most plan items. However, the HPI contains several unsupported or incorrect details (age, timing, current cast use), imaging omits a key detail from the benchmark, and the musculoskeletal section does not align with the benchmark’s expected content. Overall, moderately accurate with notable issues in HPI precision and completeness.

Not penalized for benchmark items that are not in the transcript (e.g., 'skin intact', 'no TTP'). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Includes the key benchmark plan elements (RTC in 1 week with repeat X-rays; transition to removable splints). Adds an extra plan from the transcript (protect with relative motion; RTC in 6–8), and omits the exact phrase 'Continue current treatment.' |

**Total Score:** 23

**Percentage:** 65.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures several core elements, including the HPI improvement details and imaging deferral, and largely aligns with the plan.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Conveys the same meaning as the benchmark: recurrence on the right and new triggering on the left; concise and accurate. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes key elements (follow-up, inquiry about another injection, defer right, no prior left injection), but adds exam findings (swelling, nodule) that do not belong in HPI and conflates the separate postoperative patient by implying the same patient had surgery with Dr. Hertz. Omits the detail that right-side symptoms are the same as left. The benchmark avoids these issues. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Contains the core dictated MSK lines but appends unrelated/erroneous content (incision status, sutures, PIP motion, and an imaging fragment). The benchmark includes only the verbatim MSK findings for the trigger finger. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | Benchmark notes 'X-ray showed some fracture healing.' Candidate uses 'X-rays are X-ray,' omitting the stated finding of fracture healing and providing an uninformative fragment. |
