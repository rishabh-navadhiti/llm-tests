      "Patient is a stay-at-home mom who sustained a left distal radius fracture in October 2023 following a trip and fall. She underwent surgery (ORIF) on her left wrist with Dr. Andrew Rice. She was diagnosed with CRPS at the time of injury and post-op, but has made progress. She presents today for evaluation of persistent left wrist stiffness. She is unable to extend her wrist sufficiently to perform a push-up, although she can participate in Pilates regularly without pain or limitation, using modifications."
