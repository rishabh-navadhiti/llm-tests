  "overall_summary": "The candidate note aligns well on patient identification, assessment, and planned procedure. Chief complaint and HPI are mostly accurate with minor omissions. The musculoskeletal exam lacks several verbatim findings, and imaging was incorrectly omitted despite being normal in the transcript. Overall, solid core accuracy with gaps in exam detail and imaging."
