      "justification": "Contains multiple inaccuracies and hallucinations (swelling, splinting/ice, denial of prior wrist issues, left-hand dominance) and omits key benchmark details (urgent care X-rays no fracture, sprain diagnosis, humidity in Massachusetts worsening pain, leaving Groundlings). Only the date and general mechanism align."

Overall accuracy is moderate to poor, with key factual discrepancies."
