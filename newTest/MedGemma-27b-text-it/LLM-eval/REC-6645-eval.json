    "PATIENT_NAME": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The patient's name ('Nadeem Nemi') is explicitly stated in the transcript and benchmark, but the candidate used '-'. Major omission."
    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Matches the benchmark and transcript exactly: 'Bilateral thumb pain'."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Accurately captures all key details from the benchmark/transcript: evaluation for bilateral thumb pain, worsening since 2019 and over last six months, denies numbness/tingling, significant pain, function limited."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Includes most verbatim findings (skin clean/dry/intact; no soft tissue swelling; positive grind and shoulder sign). Omits 'No triggering of any digits with the thumb.' Minor omission. Note: laterality phrasing differs between benchmark ('Right') and transcript ('bilateral'); not penalized."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 0,
      "justification": "Candidate states 'X-ray normal,' which contradicts the benchmark/transcript describing severe degenerative changes (severe joint space change, osteophytosis, Z deformity, MCP hyperextension; calcific finding noted then retracted for left)."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Includes bilateral thumb CMC arthritis, but misses benchmark conditions of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and right cubital tunnel syndrome mentioned in the transcript; adds 'stiffness,' which is not documented."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Fully aligns with benchmark: trial of CMC injections with counseling on temporary effect and rebound pain; observe carpal/cubital tunnel; consider nerve studies if symptoms recur; follow-up in 2 months."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 22,
  "percentage": 62.86,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note accurately captures the chief complaint, HPI, and plan. However, it fails to record the patientâ€™s name, misrepresents imaging as normal, and provides an incomplete assessment with an added unsupported item. Musculoskeletal exam is mostly accurate but omits a minor finding."
