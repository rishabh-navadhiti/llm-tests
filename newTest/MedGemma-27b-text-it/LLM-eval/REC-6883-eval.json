  "overall_summary": "HPI and patient name are accurate, but the note fails critical elements: missing verbatim musculoskeletal exam, incorrect imaging (stated normal despite fracture), incomplete assessment omitting the distal radius fracture, and a plan with an incorrect follow-up interval and missing cast change. Chief complaint is partially captured."
