      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Accurately summarizes follow-up status, tolerating splint, pain around the joint distal to the splint with hypersensitivity, and perceived cutaneous nerve irritation from splint pressure; no exam findings added."

      "score": 0,
      "justification": "Transcript includes verbatim MSK findings (splint in place, mild soft tissue swelling, hypersensitivity distal to splint, dorsal pressure, unable to sublux extensor tendons, excellent PAP), but the candidate left this field empty."
