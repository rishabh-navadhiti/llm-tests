  "overall_summary": "The candidate note captures the chief complaint and assessment well and provides a mostly accurate HPI. However, it diverges from the benchmark in the musculoskeletal verbatim field, uses a different format for imaging, and contains significant inaccuracies and omissions in the plan (incorrect splinting target, missing risk discussion/three injections context, and an invented follow-up interval). Overall, moderate alignment with notable issues in plan fidelity and verbatim requirements."
