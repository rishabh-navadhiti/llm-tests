Musculoskeletal verbatim partially matches but omits important dictated lines about the incision and suture removal. Imaging appropriately indicates no data with minor formatting variance. Assessment omission is acceptable given no explicit assessment in the transcript. Overall, significant omissions reduce accuracy."
