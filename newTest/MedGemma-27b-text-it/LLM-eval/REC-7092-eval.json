      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Captures the same core facts as the benchmark (injury date/mechanism, pain with motion, no deformity, ER X-ray fracture, lacerations with sutures, limited middle finger MCP motion). Minor differences include adding 'no apparent malrotation' and slight wording/formatting variations."

      "justification": "Benchmark lists 'Fracture' and 'Lacerations' (and 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact'); candidate omits 'Fracture', adds 'Hand pain', and modifies lacerations to '(healing)'. Major mismatch with key problems from the benchmark."

      "justification": "Benchmark plan includes fracture casting, continue antibiotics, protect lacerations with soft dressing, Burning Man risk education, and 2-week follow-up.

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note matches well on patient name and chief complaint and provides a mostly aligned HPI. However, it omits documented imaging findings, provides a substantially incomplete and inaccurate assessment (missing 'Fracture'), and a significantly deficient plan that conflicts with the benchmark on key management steps and follow-up. Overall accuracy is moderate to poor due to omissions in imaging, assessment, and plan."
