|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Matches benchmark: no patient name provided, correctly recorded as '-'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | Benchmark: 'Numbness and tingling in the right hand.' Candidate: 'Hand pain and numbness' adds pain, omits tingling and laterality. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes chemo for lymphoma, increasing right-hand numbness/tingling, phone use reduction, and earring difficulty. Missing burn to right thumb and 'at home more.' Adds 'denies any specific injury' (contradicts burn) and 'fine motor tasks' not stated. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Benchmark is '-', while candidate provides paraphrased findings and not verbatim doctor text; does not match benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'X-ray is clear.' |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Captures 'trigger finger' and 'right small finger nodule' but omits 'skin intact,' 'excellent ROM,' 'moderate tenderness,' and 'normal percussion of Guyon's canal.' Adds 'right hand numbness/tingling' and 'possible carpal tunnel,' which are not in the benchmark assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Includes key elements: injection for trigger finger, night splints, low threshold for nerve studies, and 2-month follow-up. Adds items not in benchmark (NSAIDs, duplicate splinting, EMG detail, 'steroid' specification), introducing unnecessary deviations. |

**Total Score:** 19

**Percentage:** 54.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures several core elements (imaging result, trigger finger injection, night splints, nerve studies, and follow-up) and includes major HPI points. However, it weakens accuracy by altering the chief complaint, inserting an incorrect denial of injury, failing to provide verbatim musculoskeletal text, omitting multiple assessment findings, and adding several plan elements not present in the benchmark.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to transcript: 'Nicole Coffee.' |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Concise and accurate: 'Left index finger pain' matches the stated reason for visit. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Captures duration, context (shoulder visit and observation), worsening, and desire for injection, but introduces an exam finding ('progressed to causing triggering') not stated as history and generalizes request ('requesting treatment') instead of specifically 'injection.' |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Not verbatim and incomplete. Wording altered ('to palpation over' vs. 'on ... with an A1 polii') and multiple dictated findings omitted (skin clean/dry/tacky, catching, triggering, ROM, thumbs up). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Meaning preserved (normal X-ray) but lacks specifics ('three views' and 'left index finger') present in the benchmark/transcript; not reported exactly as stated. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes trigger finger but omits the symptom-based problem 'Left index finger pain' listed in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Includes trigger finger injection consistent with transcript/benchmark. However, it inappropriately includes the imaging result within the plan. The benchmark's follow-up ('Return in 2 weeks') is not in the transcript, so not penalized for omission. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures key elements such as name, chief complaint, and core plan. However, it introduces an exam finding into the HPI, fails to provide verbatim and complete musculoskeletal exam details, generalizes imaging results, and omits a symptom in the assessment. Overall accuracy is moderate, with most core clinical facts present but several instruction adherence issues.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | No patient name stated in transcript; both benchmark and candidate correctly use '-'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Captures left small finger locking but omits 'and catching' present in benchmark/transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Includes onset (~2 years), location, and delay in seeking care; adds right-hand dominance from transcript. Omits reason for delay (prior trigger finger surgery) and explicit desire for treatment. The job impact noted in benchmark is not in the transcript and not penalized. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Partially verbatim but misses multiple key elements from the exam: A1 pulley detail, palpable nodule, excellent ROM, and well-healed middle finger incisions. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | Transcript notes normal X-rays; candidate marks imaging as '-', omitting this key result. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Accurately identifies left small finger trigger finger, matching benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | States plan for trigger finger release consistent with benchmark. Benchmark’s 2-week follow-up is not clearly in transcript and omission is not penalized. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note aligns well on patient identification, assessment, and planned procedure. Chief complaint and HPI are mostly accurate with minor omissions. The musculoskeletal exam lacks several verbatim findings, and imaging was incorrectly omitted despite being normal in the transcript. Overall, solid core accuracy with gaps in exam detail and imaging.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'Wrist pain'. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes improved synovitis, osteoporosis infusion, and interest in right wrist arthroplasty, but omits knee recovery enabling surgery planning and the significant functional limitation from wrist pain; also misstates 'injection' as 'medication'. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | No MSK exam verbatim in benchmark; candidate appropriately left this blank. Transcript does not provide clear MSK verbatim distinct from general exam. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | Benchmark states imaging mostly unchanged; transcript indicates imaging can be left the same. Candidate returned '-', missing that content. Not penalized for the 'delete nodule' clause since that pertains to exam per transcript. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Captures osteoporosis, wrist arthritis (but not specified bilateral), and synovitis; adds 'hand pain' and 'swelling' (swelling not stated). Omission of 'skin is intact' not penalized as it's a normal finding and not in transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Adequately reflects plan regarding right total wrist arthroplasty (worded as 'discussed'). Other benchmark items (continue infusion, RTC 2 weeks) are not in the transcript and not penalized. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly captured the chief complaint and some core HPI elements, but missed key HPI details (knee recovery, functional limitation) and mischaracterized the injection. Imaging content indicating 'unchanged' was omitted. Assessment included relevant items but added an unsupported problem and lacked bilaterality. The plan closely aligned on the arthroplasty decision, with non-transcript benchmark additions appropriately not penalized.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark and transcript: 'Stephanie Humphrey'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Benchmark specifies 'Left wrist pain'; candidate wrote 'Left hand pain', which changes the location. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | Contains multiple inaccuracies and hallucinations (swelling, splinting/ice, denial of prior wrist issues, left-hand dominance) and omits key benchmark details (urgent care X-rays no fracture, sprain diagnosis, humidity in Massachusetts worsening pain, leaving Groundlings). Only the date and general mechanism align. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Benchmark is '-', and the candidate provides a statement not verbatim from the transcript ('No tenderness to palpation over the ECU')—this was never stated. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Candidate states 'X-rays are normal,' capturing only part of the benchmark. Missing prior urgent care result ('no fractures') and laterality/context. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark includes 'Left ECU tendonitis' and 'Left ulnar-sided wrist pain.' Candidate lists 'Left wrist pain' (partial) and incorrectly adds 'Possible trigger finger,' which pertains to another patient and is not in the benchmark for this visit. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Exact match to benchmark plan: hand therapy, MRI for further evaluation, and return after MRI. |

**Total Score:** 18

**Percentage:** 51.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly captured the patient name and plan, but had significant issues in the HPI (hallucinations and incorrect dominance), an inaccurate chief complaint location, a fabricated musculoskeletal verbatim entry, partial imaging details, and an incorrect assessment item. Overall accuracy is moderate to poor, with key factual discrepancies.

# REC-6613

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to transcript: 'Precious Myles Garrett.' |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Captures left wrist pain but omits 'and masses,' which is part of the stated reason for visit. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately summarizes pain waking at night, presence of wrist and thumb masses, fluctuation then stability, and rheumatology imaging. Minor issues: lacks precise anatomical details (dorsal radial/ulnar MCP), omits rheumatologist name, and includes exam-based tenderness details. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Not verbatim and overly generalized ('No tenderness to palpation.'). Doctor stated mixed findings (non-tender wrist mass, minimally tender thumb mass) and specific tests; the candidate’s text is neither verbatim nor accurate. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | Incorrect and self-contradictory. Transcript: X-ray shows thumb MCP osteophyte; ultrasound shows bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte at dorsal MCP of thumb and a retinacular cyst superficial to the first dorsal compartment. Candidate mislocates findings to the wrist and adds 'X-ray normal.' |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Misses key diagnoses (left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte) and adds 'trigger finger,' which is explicitly negated in the exam (no A1 tenderness/locking). Uses vague 'masses' and pain terms instead of specific findings. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Partially aligns on follow-up timing and splinting but misses 'night' splints, omits observation for masses and consideration of aspiration/biopsy, and adds non-dictated items (A1 pulley steroid injection, surgical options). |

**Total Score:** 16

**Percentage:** 45.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note gets the patient name correct and provides a generally accurate HPI, but it omits 'masses' in the chief complaint and fails the verbatim MSK requirement. Imaging, assessment, and plan contain significant inaccuracies and hallucinated elements (e.g., normal X-ray, trigger finger, A1 pulley injection), deviating from the transcript and benchmark.

| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes pain waking at night and rheumatology visit, but omits multiple benchmark details (right-hand dominance, occupation, Dr. Ishimori, prior specific diagnoses, mass size history) and adds an unsupported 'trigger finger' history. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Benchmark provides no verbatim content ('-'); candidate also provides none. Harmless formatting difference (empty vs '-'). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | Partially correct (mentions osteophytes and retinacular cyst) but incorrectly states normal wrist x-ray/ultrasound and omits the 'bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte' detail present in the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Contains multiple unsupported problems (trigger finger, wrist/CMC arthritis) and duplicates, while missing key benchmark items (left thumb MCP osteophyte, bilateral thumb/MCP masses). Only partial overlap with wrist cyst. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Matches night splints, observation, and RTC 6 weeks, but omits 'aspiration vs biopsy of the wrist mass' and adds unsupported interventions (steroid injection, trigger finger splinting, NSAIDs, activity modification). |

**Total Score:** 17

**Percentage:** 48.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate captured the chief complaint and some plan elements but missed the patient name, omitted several key HPI details, added unsupported diagnoses (trigger finger, arthritis), and misreported imaging with contradictory normal findings. Overall, significant inaccuracies and omissions reduce fidelity to the benchmark.

| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Includes injection for trigger finger and plantar tendonitis home exercise program with low threshold for formal therapy, aligning with benchmark content. Omits 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks' (present in benchmark but not in transcript; not penalized). Minor wording addition ('with home exercises') not verbatim. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captures the patient name, chief complaint, and most of the plan. HPI is close with minor non-essential phrasing. Musculoskeletal and imaging omissions are handled appropriately. The main deficiency is the assessment, which misses 'Plantar tendonitis' included in the benchmark. Overall, solid but with a notable omission in assessment and minor formatting/wording variances.

| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Captures follow-up and no pain, but adds an inferred statement ('denies any significant issues') and omits 'He wants to know what is going on' from the benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Provides only a fragment ('pin sites clean dry and intact') and misses key dictated details (no erythema/ecchymosis, no significant tenderness, stable alignment, stiff fingers). Not fully verbatim. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | Candidate says 'X-ray normal,' which contradicts the transcript and benchmark ('X-rays are the same as the last time.'). This is a hallucinated interpretation. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Candidate lists 'Hand pain' (contradicts 'no pain') and 'Stiff finger' (singular vs 'stiff fingers'). Benchmark contains different items. Major content mismatch. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 0 | Completely diverges from the dictated plan. Invents 'Continue current management' and 'Follow up in 4 weeks' instead of the specific plan (continue plexal ligament split, review X-rays, transition to phenylplastic splint, referral to Eliza Cherian, RTC in 10 days). |

**Total Score:** 14

**Percentage:** 40.0

**Overall Summary:** Patient name was correct, and HPI partially aligned. However, chief complaint did not match the benchmark focus, musculoskeletal findings were incomplete and not verbatim, imaging was incorrectly summarized as normal, the assessment included incorrect and mismatched items, and the plan was largely fabricated with the wrong follow-up timeline.

| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Benchmark includes 'Thumb pain', 'Middle finger triggering and locking', 'Right upper extremity skin is intact', and 'No tenderness to palpation.' Candidate lists 'Hand pain', 'Middle finger locking', and 'Trigger finger (right middle finger)'. It substitutes 'hand' for 'thumb', omits items present in the benchmark, and adds a diagnosis not listed. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Includes injection for the middle finger, aligning with the benchmark. However, it misspells the medication ('cycloprog' vs 'cycloprox') and omits 'activity as tolerated' which is stated in the transcript. It also adds A1 pulley specificity not in the benchmark. The benchmark's 'return in 2 weeks' was not in the transcript, so omission is not penalized. |

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures some core patient-reported details and the follow-up interval but introduces unsupported elements (CC, HPI context, assessment) and includes excessive, non-verbatim content in the MSK exam. Formatting for imaging was nonstandard. Overall fidelity to the benchmark is moderate with notable inaccuracies.

# REC-6904

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to transcript and benchmark: 'Jane Pollock'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Benchmark is 'Follow-up'. Candidate adds 'for right upper extremity incisions,' which is not stated as the complaint and adds unnecessary detail. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures key facts (follow-up, doing well, sore/stiff, not too painful, bruising). Omits minor details in benchmark (husband present; uncertainty if bruising is normal). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Not verbatim and misses multiple specifics from benchmark/transcript (e.g., 'with sutures', 'to the palm', 'about 4 cm from palm', 'unable to straighten'). Paraphrased and simplified. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Benchmark indicates no imaging ('-'). Candidate left the field empty, which conveys the same meaning but does not follow the default formatting. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Benchmark lists 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation.' Candidate instead lists 'Postoperative status (right upper extremity)'. Content differs notably. (Note: 'No tenderness to palpation' is not in the transcript; not penalized for that omission.) |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Benchmark includes return in 1 week and 6 days, soft dressing, and consideration of suture removal and initiation of therapy. Candidate includes 1-week follow-up and suture removal consideration but omits soft dressing and 6-day follow-up, and adds 'Continue with current therapy,' which is not stated. |

**Total Score:** 22

**Percentage:** 62.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the patient name and core HPI well, with a generally correct indication of no imaging results. However, it adds detail to the chief complaint, paraphrases and omits key specifics in the musculoskeletal verbatim section, diverges in the assessment content, and incompletely reflects the plan while adding a non-dictated instruction.

# REC-6911

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | Benchmark lists 'Walt' from the transcript; candidate returned '-', missing the explicitly stated name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | Benchmark: 'Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.' Candidate: 'Wants to know when numbness will resolve.' While derived from the transcript, it does not match the benchmark chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Candidate includes minimal pain and question about numbness, but omits 'busy day' and occupation, and frames as 'status post carpal tunnel release' rather than presenting with CTS per benchmark. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Benchmark verbatim: 'Incision clean... moderate ecchymosis... good finger motion though not full.' Candidate contradicts (e.g., 'No ecchymosis') and is not verbatim. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Benchmark indicates no imaging ('-'). Candidate left the field empty rather than returning '-', a minor formatting difference with same meaning. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes the benchmark item 'Status post carpal tunnel release' and adds 'Numbness/tingling,' which is consistent with transcript but not in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Candidate captured 'Return to clinic in 4 weeks,' but omitted 'Planned post-op endo carpal tunnel' present in the benchmark plan. |

**Total Score:** 17

**Percentage:** 48.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures some key elements (minimal pain, numbness concern, RTC in 4 weeks) but misses the patient name, diverges on chief complaint, fails to provide verbatim MSK findings, and omits part of the plan. Assessment and imaging are largely aligned, with minor deviations.

# REC-6922

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to the transcript: 'Mahika Mahendru'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Candidate states 'Follow-up for splint' but omits key detail of 'pain distal to the splint' present in the benchmark/transcript; follow-up context captured. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Accurately summarizes follow-up status, tolerating splint, pain around the joint distal to the splint with hypersensitivity, and perceived cutaneous nerve irritation from splint pressure; no exam findings added. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Transcript includes verbatim MSK findings (splint in place, mild soft tissue swelling, hypersensitivity distal to splint, dorsal pressure, unable to sublux extensor tendons, excellent PAP), but the candidate left this field empty. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | No imaging mentioned. Benchmark shows '-', while candidate left the field empty; meaning aligns (no imaging), but formatting deviates. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Should list 'Hypersensitivity distal to the splint' based on the transcript; candidate provided nothing. Note: benchmark also includes 'Skin is intact' and 'No tenderness to palpation,' which are not in the transcript and are not required. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 0 | Transcript plan: modify splint; return Monday if no improvement after modification; return in 3 weeks. Candidate omitted the plan entirely. |

**Total Score:** 18

**Percentage:** 51.43

**Overall Summary:** Accurate patient name and an excellent HPI. Chief complaint is incomplete, MSK verbatim and plan are missing, and assessment omits the key active problem. Imaging absence is conveyed but not formatted per instructions.

# REC-7060

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly use '-' as the patient's name is not stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Candidate succinctly captures the complaint as trigger finger of the right ring finger, consistent with the benchmark's 'Trigger finger.' |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Content largely matches the benchmark (follow-up for thumb CMC arthritis; right ring trigger finger; managing thumb well; progressed to full trigger; asking next steps). Minor discrepancies include 'recurrence' vs 'new-onset' and onset stated as '2020–2021' vs 'around 2020.' |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark has '-' while candidate includes paraphrased exam findings and not verbatim quotes. This is a major mismatch relative to the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Both indicate no imaging results. Candidate uses an empty list while the benchmark uses '-'; minor formatting difference. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: Right thumb CMC arthritis; Right ring finger trigger finger. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Partial overlap: includes surgical release concept and continued management. However, it omits 'discuss risks' and the context of 'after three injections,' misstates splinting target (right ring finger vs carpal tunnel), and invents a 6-week follow-up instead of the benchmark’s 2 weeks. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the chief complaint and assessment well and provides a mostly accurate HPI. However, it diverges from the benchmark in the musculoskeletal verbatim field, uses a different format for imaging, and contains significant inaccuracies and omissions in the plan (incorrect splinting target, missing risk discussion/three injections context, and an invented follow-up interval). Overall, moderate alignment with notable issues in plan fidelity and verbatim requirements.

# REC-7074

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | The transcript explicitly states the patient's name as 'Math,' but the candidate returned '-'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Candidate lists 'Left wrist stiffness and limited range of motion.' Benchmark is 'Left wrist stiffness.' Minor extra wording but meaning preserved. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures the fracture in Oct 2023, surgery, CRPS diagnosis, ongoing stiffness, inability to do push-ups, and ability to do Pilates with modifications. Minor inference by specifying 'ORIF' which is not explicitly stated. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Not verbatim and includes fabricated findings (no TTP, no swelling, grip strength) while omitting dictated details (flexion ~45, extension ~20, minimal scar, excellent finger motion). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 2 | Partially matches 'well-healed fracture,' but omits key dictated details: 'stable hardware,' 'plate alignment looks good,' 'overall reduction adequate,' and 'post-op left wrist.' |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark lists CRPS and status post left distal radius fracture. Candidate lists symptoms (stiffness, limited extension) and omits both benchmark problems. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 0 | Candidate fabricates 'continue with current therapy' and incorrect follow-up '4 weeks.' Benchmark plan is advance activity as tolerated, return to Pilates, and follow-up in 3 months. |

**Total Score:** 11

**Percentage:** 31.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the general HPI and chief complaint reasonably well but fails critical fields: incorrect omission of patient name, non-verbatim and fabricated musculoskeletal exam, incomplete imaging details, incorrect assessment relative to the benchmark, and an inaccurate plan with invented elements and wrong follow-up interval.

# REC-7079

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 0 | Patient name 'Bertha Campos' is clearly stated in the transcript and benchmark, but the candidate returned '-'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 0 | Benchmark shows 'Follow up for sutures removal' based on transcript, but the candidate left this field empty. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 0 | Transcript supports an HPI about follow-up and asking for suture removal with improved motion; candidate provided no HPI content. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Candidate correctly captured ROM, near tight fist without pain, full active extension, no triggering, and moderate ecchymosis, but omitted dictated lines on the incision being clean/intact, sutures removed today, and no complications. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | No imaging mentioned in transcript; benchmark uses '-', candidate left the field empty. Content equivalent with minor formatting difference. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Benchmark lists items not supported by the transcript. No assessment items are explicitly stated in the transcript, so the candidate’s omission should not be penalized. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 0 | Transcript and benchmark indicate sutures were removed today (and benchmark adds follow-up/exercises), but the candidate provided no plan. |

**Total Score:** 12

**Percentage:** 34.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate missed key sections (name, chief complaint, HPI, and plan). Musculoskeletal verbatim partially matches but omits important dictated lines about the incision and suture removal. Imaging appropriately indicates no data with minor formatting variance. Assessment omission is acceptable given no explicit assessment in the transcript. Overall, significant omissions reduce accuracy.

# REC-7092

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly return '-' as no patient name is stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'Left index finger injury.' |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Captures the same core facts as the benchmark (injury date/mechanism, pain with motion, no deformity, ER X-ray fracture, lacerations with sutures, limited middle finger MCP motion). Minor differences include adding 'no apparent malrotation' and slight wording/formatting variations. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Both indicate no verbatim musculoskeletal exam text provided; factual content aligns. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 0 | Benchmark documents ER X-ray showing a fracture and a prior X-ray with a minimally displaced small finger fracture; candidate provides no imaging results. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark lists 'Fracture' and 'Lacerations' (and 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact'); candidate omits 'Fracture', adds 'Hand pain', and modifies lacerations to '(healing)'. Major mismatch with key problems from the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 0 | Benchmark plan includes fracture casting, continue antibiotics, protect lacerations with soft dressing, Burning Man risk education, and 2-week follow-up. Candidate says only 'Continue splinting' and 'Follow up in 4 weeks,' omitting key elements and giving an incorrect follow-up interval. |

**Total Score:** 20

**Percentage:** 57.142857142857146

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note matches well on patient name and chief complaint and provides a mostly aligned HPI. However, it omits documented imaging findings, provides a substantially incomplete and inaccurate assessment (missing 'Fracture'), and a significantly deficient plan that conflicts with the benchmark on key management steps and follow-up. Overall accuracy is moderate to poor due to omissions in imaging, assessment, and plan.

# REC-7241

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly use '-' as no patient name is explicitly mentioned in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 2 | Candidate says 'Recurrence of hand symptoms,' which is vague and omits key specifics from the benchmark: trigger finger, right recurrence, and new left-sided triggering. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate includes the follow-up and bilateral triggering with inquiry about another injection, but omits multiple explicit details from the transcript captured in the benchmark: deferring right-sided injection today and no prior injections on the left with plan to inject today. Also omits mention of the additional patient (James She) follow-up context. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Transcript verbatim is: 'Moderate soft tissue swelling, there is triggering of the middle finger. There is a nodule there that is triggering that.' Candidate reduces this to 'moderate swelling,' which is not verbatim and misses substantial dictated content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 1 | Transcript indicates X-rays with 'some fracture healing.' Benchmark reflects 'X-ray showed some fracture healing.' Candidate returns '-', missing the explicit imaging result. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Candidate lists right and left trigger finger, matching core problems. However, benchmark also includes 'Status post surgery' (present in transcript for another patient); candidate omits this. Not penalized for normal findings in benchmark that are not clearly in the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Candidate includes only 'Hold off on injection for now,' capturing the right-sided deferral. It misses additional dictated plan elements present in the transcript and benchmark: left middle finger injection today, continued post-op protocol per Dr. Hertz, and follow-up with Dr. Hertz. Not penalized for 'Return to clinic in 4 weeks' since that timing is not clearly stated in the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 18

**Percentage:** 51.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the broad theme (bilateral trigger finger and deferring injection), but lacks key specifics across multiple fields. It misses exact wording where verbatim text is required, omits the imaging result, and provides an incomplete HPI and plan compared to the benchmark. Most omissions correspond to details explicitly present in the transcript.

# REC-7270

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Correctly returned '-' since no name appears in the transcript; matches benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Captures hand contracture but omits 'bilateral,' which is specified in the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Includes core history (onset left, now right; left can't lie flat) but adds exam details (right hand nodules/no contracture) and omits the stated purpose of visit (evaluation/treatment). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 0 | Transcript contains detailed musculoskeletal exam verbatim, but candidate left this section empty. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Includes normal X-ray but omits that an MRI is needed, which is stated in transcript and benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes 'Dupuytren's contracture' but misses the benchmark item 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact' and adds 'Hand contracture' not listed in benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | Medication name incorrect ('Zileuton' vs 'Zylex' per benchmark/transcript) and invented follow-up ('in 4 weeks') instead of 'return when medication is acquired.' |

**Total Score:** 18

**Percentage:** 51.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the general problem and some history accurately but misses key specifics (bilateral nature, MRI needed), omits verbatim musculoskeletal exam, and significantly deviates in the plan (wrong medication and invented follow-up). Overall fidelity to the benchmark is moderate to low.

# REC-7284

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | No patient name stated in transcript; candidate and benchmark both correctly use '-'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Candidate states 'Right middle finger injury' vs benchmark 'Right middle finger crush injury'; minor omission of 'crush' but core meaning preserved. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Matches benchmark content and chronology: date, mechanism (dumbbell crush), immediate symptoms, urgent care x-rays, splint, repeat x-rays at 4 weeks showing continued fracture, and current visit for evaluation. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark is '-', while candidate includes 'Some hematoma noted.' Despite being in the transcript, it does not match the benchmark ground truth content for this field. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Candidate captures today's x-ray finding (distal phalanx fracture with stable alignment and good healing) but omits prior urgent care and 4-week repeat x-ray results included in the benchmark and slightly paraphrases wording. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate includes 'hand pain' and 'swelling' not listed in the benchmark and misses several benchmark items (e.g., crush injury, paresthesia). Partial overlap with 'fracture healing' and 'stiffness.' Not penalized for 'skin is intact' since that detail is not in the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Candidate correctly lists advancing activity and avoiding hanging, but gives follow-up as 4 weeks and omits '3 weeks for nail check before wedding,' which the benchmark reflects as the final instruction. |

**Total Score:** 22

**Percentage:** 62.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note is strong on HPI and captures the chief complaint reasonably well. It underperforms on imaging by omitting prior study results, diverges from the benchmark in the musculoskeletal verbatim field, and the assessment misses several benchmark problems while adding others. The plan contains a significant discrepancy in follow-up timing and omits the nail-check detail.
