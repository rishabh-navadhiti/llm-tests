      "Precious Myles Garrett, a right-hand dominant children's social worker, presents with left wrist pain that is more bothersome than the masses and wakes her up at night. She reports a history of a mass at the dorsal radial aspect of her left wrist and another at the dorsal ulnar aspect of the left thumb MCP joint. Both masses have been fluctuating in size in the past but have remained constant recently. She was evaluated by her rheumatologist who performed X-rays and an ultrasound of the wrist. She is seeking evaluation and treatment for her symptoms."
