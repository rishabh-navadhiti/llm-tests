      "Precious Myles Garrett, a right-hand dominant children's social worker, presents with left wrist pain that is more bothersome than the masses and wakes her up at night. She reports that the masses, which were previously fluctuating in size, have now been stable. She was evaluated by Dr. Ishimori and diagnosed with left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte, and bilateral thumb and MCP joint osteophytes. She saw her rheumatologist who performed X-rays and an ultrasound of the front of the wrist. She is here for evaluation and treatment of these symptoms."
