      "Greta Griswana presents for follow-up with persistent thumb pain despite improvement in forearm pain. The thumb pain is described as severe and significantly impacting her daily function. She reports that her pain has not improved since her last visit. On exam, there is significant tenderness at the trapeziometacarpal joint with a positive grind test. There is no tenderness at the A1 pulley, but there is some tenderness with U&R imminence. X-rays show degenerative changes consistent with arthritis. She is being considered for a steroid injection given the persistent symptoms and imaging findings."
