      "The patient is a left-hand dominant artist who does miniatures for stop-motion films. He presents with index finger pain and stiffness that began after he lacerated his finger on 7-16-25 while working with a chisel. He states he hit a hard piece of wood and it slipped and cut his finger. He went to urgent care where the wound was irrigated and repaired. The sutures were removed about 14 days later. When the stitches were removed, the wound opened up. He is now here for evaluation of a stiff finger. On exam, the left upper extremity has a laceration that is well-healing without sutures. The index finger PIP is very stiff, able to flex only about 10 degrees actively at this time. There is moderate soft tissue swelling, no sensory tenderness to palpation. Excellent range of motion of the remaining digits."
