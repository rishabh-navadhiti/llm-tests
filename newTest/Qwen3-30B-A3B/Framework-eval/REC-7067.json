      "The patient noticed a new mass or bump at the ulnar border of her index finger DIP joint a few weeks ago. She is concerned because this is different from the bumps she typically gets from her arthritis. The mass does not limit her function. She wants to make sure everything is okay. She has been doing well since May, feeling like she has been making progress with her health and wrist function. She is able to do more with her wrist without pain and has been able to lift some weights. She still experiences some aches and pains in her wrist and shoulder, but overall function has improved."
