      "The patient is a stay-at-home mom who sustained a left distal radius fracture in October 2023 following a fall. She underwent surgery with Dr. Andrew Rice and was diagnosed with CRPS post-operatively. She reports significant improvement since then but continues to experience persistent stiffness in her left wrist. She is unable to extend her wrist sufficiently to perform a push-up, although she can perform Pilates regularly without pain or limitation, using modifications. She presents for evaluation and treatment of ongoing wrist stiffness."
