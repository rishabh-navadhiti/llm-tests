      "The patient is a left hand dominant individual who sustained an injury to his left index finger at 8:15 AM on the 25th when a camping trunk hinge opened and struck his hand. He reports pain with motion. There is no deformity or angulation. He was taken to the emergency room where X-rays were performed, revealing a fracture. He has two lacerations on the dorsal aspect of the left index finger and the ulnar border of the index finger in the second web space, which are well approximated with interrupted suture material. He has limited flexion and extension of the middle finger at the proximal interphalangeal joint. The fracture is minimally displaced. The patient is scheduled to attend Burning Man on Friday at age 22. He was counseled on risks of sand and sweat exposure leading to infection. He is currently on antibiotics for a few more days and will return to clinic upon return from Burning Man."
