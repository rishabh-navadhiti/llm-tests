He has a separation of the nail fold from the nail bed on the ring finger and significant ecchymosis on the middle finger. The distal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger is stiff, while the PIP joints have excellent motion. The patient denies a fracture and now has post-traumatic arthritis. He is following up for wound check and repeat X-rays in one week."
