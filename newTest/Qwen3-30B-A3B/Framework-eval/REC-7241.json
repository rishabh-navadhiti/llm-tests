      "The patient is a follow-up for recurrence of trigger finger on the right hand and new triggering on the left hand. He had prior surgery with Doctor Hertz and currently has a pin in place. He is currently undergoing post-op protocol. He is seeking evaluation on whether it is too soon to have another injection. He reports moderate soft tissue swelling bilaterally, with triggering of the middle finger on both sides. A nodule is present on the left middle finger causing triggering. He has not received any injections on the left side. He would like to defer injection on the right side for now, which is considered reasonable. The plan is to proceed with injection on the left middle finger today."
