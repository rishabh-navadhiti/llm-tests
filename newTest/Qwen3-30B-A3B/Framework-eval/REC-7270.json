      "The patient is a dominant retiree with bilateral hand Dupuytren's disease. He first noticed symptoms in his left hand many years ago, and now he is beginning to notice similar changes in his right hand. The left hand is unable to lie flat on the table due to significant contracture of the ring finger. He has a 45-degree contracture at the ring finger metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint and approximately 10 degrees of contracture at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. There is no measurable contracture in the remaining digits of the left hand. The right hand has intact skin with nodules along the ring finger ray, but no evidence of contracture. He is here for evaluation and treatment."
