      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Includes all key elements from the benchmark (post-chemo lymphoma, increased home time, right hand numbness/tingling, right thumb burn affecting sensation and earrings, reduced phone holding) without adding unsupported details."

    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Candidate provides verbatim musculoskeletal exam text from the transcript, whereas the benchmark contains '-'. This is a major mismatch relative to the benchmark content."

      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Captures all plan elements conceptually (injection for trigger finger, night splints, low threshold for nerve studies, 2-month follow-up) but does not explicitly state 'injection' as in the benchmark, instead paraphrasing with transcript phrasing."

  "total_score": 27,
  "percentage": 77.14,
  "overall_summary": "Strong alignment with the benchmark on patient name, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging. Plan is well-captured with minor wording differences. Notable discrepancies are in the musculoskeletal verbatim field (benchmark is '-') and assessment, where several benchmark-listed findings are missing and additional items are included."
