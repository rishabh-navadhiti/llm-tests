      "score": 2,

      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Includes 'The imaging you can leave all the same,' but omits the benchmark detail to delete the large, poorly defined nodule."

      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Correctly lists bilateral wrist arthritis and synovitis, but omits osteoporosis present in the transcript/benchmark and adds 'status post knee replacement.' Not penalized for missing 'skin intact' since it's not in the transcript."

    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Appropriately plans for right wrist arthroplasty and continuation of osteoporosis infusion (aligned with benchmark), but adds an unsupported follow-up statement. Not penalized for missing 'RTC in 2 weeks' since that timing is not in the transcript."

  "total_score": 25,
  "percentage": 71.43,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note aligns well with the benchmark on core facts (HPI, surgical interest, improved synovitis, osteoporosis infusion). Deviations include an over-detailed chief complaint, inclusion of non-specific exam/imaging text in the musculoskeletal section, omission of osteoporosis in the assessment, and an unsupported follow-up in the plan. Overall, mostly accurate with some formatting and detail discrepancies."
