      "score": 3,

      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Fully matches the benchmark findings (thumb MCP osteophyte on X-ray; ultrasound showing bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte at dorsal MCP and a retinacular cyst at the first dorsal compartment). Only tense/wording differs slightly."

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Includes two correct problems (left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst; left thumb MCP osteophyte) but adds 'bilateral osteophytes' which is not supported by the benchmark or clear in the transcript, and omits 'bilateral hand pain' present in the benchmark."

      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Includes night splints, aspiration/biopsy consideration, and 6-week follow-up, but omits 'Recommend observation for now for the masses' present in the benchmark; adds 'Review clinical scenario and images' which is not part of the benchmark plan."

  "overall_summary": "Strong performance on patient identification, HPI, and imaging, with accurate transcript-based content. The chief complaint is incomplete, the musculoskeletal field contains accurate transcript content but diverges from the benchmarkâ€™s '-', the assessment includes an unsupported diagnosis and misses an item, and the plan omits the observation recommendation while adding a non-essential step."
