      "justification": "Mostly aligns with benchmark and transcript, but incorrectly specifies 'bilateral thumb and MCP joint osteophytes' instead of the benchmark's non-specific 'issues/masses'. Otherwise, details about pain severity, nocturnal symptoms, prior evaluations, and imaging are accurate."

      "justification": "Content matches benchmark: osteophyte on thumb MCP x-ray; ultrasound with bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte at dorsal thumb MCP; wrist ultrasound showing retinacular cyst superficial to first dorsal compartment sheath."

    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Includes key problems but labels 'bilateral thumb and MCP joint' as osteophytes rather than 'masses' per benchmark. Not penalized for omitting normal/negative items in benchmark that are not supported by the transcript."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark in patient name, chief complaint, and imaging. HPI has a minor diagnostic specificity error regarding bilateral thumb/MCP findings. The assessment mirrors this issue. The plan is mostly correct but misses 'night splints.' The MSK verbatim content, while accurate to the transcript, does not match the benchmarkâ€™s '-' entry."
