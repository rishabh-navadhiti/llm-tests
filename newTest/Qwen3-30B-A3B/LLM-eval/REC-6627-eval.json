      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Accurately captures onset (around July 1, 2025), pregnancy context, OB referral for injections, and splints not helping sleep. Slight extra inference ('persisted despite conservative management') goes beyond the benchmark."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Benchmark lists '-', whereas the candidate provides verbatim exam text. Despite being present in the transcript, this does not match the benchmark ground truth for this field."

    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Correctly includes 'X-rays deferred secondary to pregnancy' as in the benchmark, but adds an extra non-imaging clause ('it'll be planned carpal tunnel')."

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Overlaps with benchmark on carpal tunnel syndrome but omits 'decreased sensation to the middle fingers' and 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' Adds symptom items not present in the benchmark list."

    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Captures injections (with risks discussed, done today) and the 3-month follow-up with postpartum condition, aligning with transcript. Omits the benchmark's mention that she is currently wearing splints."

  "total_score": 25,
  "percentage": 71.43,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note aligns well with the benchmark on chief complaint, HPI core details, imaging deferral, and plan timing/details. It diverges by adding non-benchmark content in MUSC and IMAGING fields and misses specific assessment items present in the benchmark. Overall, mostly accurate with a few discrepancies and minor over-inferences."
