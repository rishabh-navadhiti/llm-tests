    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 2,

      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Benchmark is a concise patient-reported symptom summary. Candidate adds non-HPI and inferred details (post-operative status, splint use, weight-bearing, follow-up/plan) not confined to patient history and not all stated in transcript."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Benchmark uses 'Right upper extremity Skin is intact.' Candidate uses a different verbatim line ('finger rotation appears...') and appears truncated; both are in transcript but candidate does not match the benchmark content."

      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Benchmark: 'Four view X-ray showed extraarticular stable fracture with minimal healing.' Candidate: '4 views. It's extra footstep stable and with minimal fracture healing.' Minor wording/ASR differences; core meaning aligns."

    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Benchmark lists exam-oriented assessment items ('Skin is intact', 'No tenderness to palpation'). Candidate lists symptoms and inferred status post condition; does not match benchmark content. Note: some benchmark items are not clearly stated in transcript, but scoring is against benchmark."

    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Candidate captures most plan elements (continue ulnar gutter splint, down weight-bearing, 3-week follow-up, transition to thermoplastic splint, therapy prescription). It omits explicit mention of 'splint change' present in the benchmark."

  "total_score": 19,
  "percentage": 54.29,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note matches the benchmark on patient name, closely aligns on imaging and plan, but diverges significantly on chief complaint, HPI, assessment, and musculoskeletal verbatim content. Inclusion of inferred/non-HPI details and mismatch with benchmark phrasing reduced scores."
