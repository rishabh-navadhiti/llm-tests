      "justification": "Includes correct elements (doing well, minimal pain, lots of ecchymosis) but adds non-HPI details (exam/plan), misattributes '1 cm from palm' to incision, and includes follow-upâ€”deviating from transcript-only HPI."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note captures some key facts (HPI symptoms, no imaging, follow-up timing) but deviates from the benchmark by inferring a chief complaint, mixing exam/plan into HPI, overextending the musculoskeletal verbatim section, and providing a non-matching assessment with an extra placeholder item. Overall alignment is moderate with notable inaccuracies and formatting issues."
