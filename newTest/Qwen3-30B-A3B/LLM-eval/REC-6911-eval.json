      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Benchmark: 'Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.' Candidate: 'Numbness after carpal tunnel release,' which shifts focus and adds postop context. While numbness is mentioned in the transcript, this does not match the benchmarkâ€™s chief complaint exactly."

    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "Candidate captures minimal pain and concern about numbness, but omits the 'busy day' detail and adds 'underwent carpal tunnel release,' which is not stated in the benchmark HPI. Not penalizing absence of 'police officer' since that expansion of 'PO1' is not clearly stated in the transcript."

    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Findings match the benchmark content: clean incision, variant sutures, moderate ecchymosis consistent with postoperative state, and good but not full finger motion. Minor fillers do not change factual content."

  "percentage": 60.0,
  "overall_summary": "The candidate note captures musculoskeletal findings, lack of imaging, and the plan well. However, it misses the patient name and the assessment from the benchmark, and shows partial deviations in chief complaint and HPI (omitting 'busy day' and adding surgical detail). Overall, moderate alignment with key clinical content but with notable omissions."
