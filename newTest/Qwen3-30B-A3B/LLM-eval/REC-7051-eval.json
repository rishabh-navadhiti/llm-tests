Multiple differences from ground truth."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for patient name, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging, and largely aligns with the plan aside from follow-up interval wording. However, it diverges in the assessment by adding/modifying items and misses the benchmark’s inclusion of certain exam findings. The musculoskeletal verbatim field notably does not match the benchmark and mixes exam with imaging content."
