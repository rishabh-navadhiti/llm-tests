      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Candidate includes conservative management and surgical release after three injections, which aligns with the benchmark. However, it incorrectly adds 'Proceed with carpal tunnel release' (benchmark indicates continuing night splinting) and does not include discussing risks; also uses 'night lifting' rather than 'night splinting' per the benchmark. Do not penalize for the benchmark-only follow-up timing."

Chief complaint and non-imaging fields are generally aligned, and imaging is correctly left as '-'."
