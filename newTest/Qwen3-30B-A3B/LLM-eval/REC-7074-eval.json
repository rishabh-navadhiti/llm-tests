    },
    "CHIEF_COMPLAINT": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Meaning matches 'Left wrist stiffness' but adds extra context ('since fracture'), making it slightly less concise than the benchmark."
    },
    "HPI_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Accurately summarizes the course: Oct 2023 left distal radius fracture from a fall, surgery with Dr. Rice, CRPS diagnosis, persistent stiffness limiting push-ups, able to do Pilates with modifications. Minor variance on timing of CRPS ('post-operatively' vs 'at time of injury') and inclusion of social detail; overall meaning preserved."
    },
    "MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Nearly verbatim to benchmark; differs by 'while healing' vs 'well healing'. Otherwise matches phrasing and measurements."
    },
    "IMAGING_RESULTS": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Captures key findings (well-healed fracture, hardware, good plate alignment, adequate reduction). Omits 'left wrist,' 'post-op,' and 'stable' wording present in benchmark."
    },
    "ASSESSMENT_SPENCER": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Includes CRPS and status post distal radius fracture (worded slightly differently) and adds persistent wrist stiffness, which is a relevant active problem. Content aligns with benchmark without contradictions."
    },
    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "Contains core elements from the benchmark (advance activity/return to Pilates, 3-month follow-up) and adds counseling about push-up limitation and reviewing X-rays, both stated in the transcript. Minor phrasing differences."
