      "justification": "Includes core facts (mechanism, timing around 8/15/25, pain with motion, no deformity/angulation, ED visit with fracture, lacerations), but has multiple inaccuracies and additions: wrong hand dominance (left vs transcript right), misinterpreted date/time ('8:15 AM on the 25th'), wrong joint (PIP vs MCP), adds 'minimally displaced' not stated for the index finger, and introduces non-HPI details ('age 22', counseling and plan)."

    "PLAN_SPENCER_": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Closely aligns with benchmark plan: fracture cast, protect lacerations with soft dressing under splint, Burning Man risk counseling (sand/sweat), antibiotics for a few days, and follow-up on return. The benchmark's 'return in 2 weeks' detail is not in the transcript; no penalty applied."

  "total_score": 24,

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note correctly captured the chief complaint and plan, and partially matched imaging and assessment. However, the HPI contained several factual inaccuracies (hand dominance, date/time, joint specificity, and an unwarranted 'minimally displaced' qualifier) and included plan details. The musculoskeletal verbatim section did not match the benchmark and mixed in non-exam content. Overall accuracy is moderate with notable errors in HPI and MSK sections."
