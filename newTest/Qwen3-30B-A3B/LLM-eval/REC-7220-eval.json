  "overall_summary": "The candidate note partially aligns with the benchmark on core elements (patient name, imaging, parts of the plan). However, it includes inappropriate objective findings and plan details in the HPI, adds extraneous items to the Assessment and Plan (some likely from a second patient), and deviates from the concise chief complaint. Overall, there are several content mismatches with the benchmark despite some correct elements."
