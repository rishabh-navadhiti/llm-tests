      "score": 2,
      "justification": "Includes exam measurements (45° MP, 10° PIP) not appropriate for HPI and specifies 'ring finger' instead of 'little finger' as in the benchmark; otherwise captures onset and progression."

  "overall_summary": "The candidate note aligns on patient name and plan, and mostly matches the chief complaint and musculoskeletal section with minor phrasing differences. The HPI includes inappropriate exam details and an incorrect finger specification relative to the benchmark. Imaging omits the MRI need, and the assessment diverges notably from the benchmark."
