| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Matches benchmark '-' exactly; no patient name stated in transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Conveys the same complaint as benchmark with minor wording difference ('increasing'), which is supported by the transcript and remains concise. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Includes all key elements from the benchmark (post-chemo lymphoma, increased home time, right hand numbness/tingling, right thumb burn affecting sensation and earrings, reduced phone holding) without adding unsupported details. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Candidate provides verbatim musculoskeletal exam text from the transcript, whereas the benchmark contains '-'. This is a major mismatch relative to the benchmark content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'X-ray is clear'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Overlaps with benchmark on 'Trigger finger' but omits multiple benchmark items (skin intact, normal percussion of Guyon's canal, moderate tenderness, excellent ROM, nodule) and adds items not listed in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Captures all plan elements conceptually (injection for trigger finger, night splints, low threshold for nerve studies, 2-month follow-up) but does not explicitly state 'injection' as in the benchmark, instead paraphrasing with transcript phrasing. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** Strong alignment with the benchmark on patient name, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging. Plan is well-captured with minor wording differences. Notable discrepancies are in the musculoskeletal verbatim field (benchmark is '-') and assessment, where several benchmark-listed findings are missing and additional items are included.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to the patient name stated in the transcript and benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Meaningfully identical to the benchmark ('Pain in left index finger' vs 'Left index finger pain'); concise and accurate. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Contains all key facts from the benchmark: location, duration (few/several months), context with shoulder visit and observation by Dr. Almadroa, worsening course, and desire for injection. No added inferences. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Includes some dictated phrases (tenderness at A1 pulley, catching, triggering) but omits multiple verbatim elements present in the transcript and benchmark (skin clean/dry/tacky, excellent ROM, thumbs up). The field requires complete verbatim extraction. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Accurately reflects the transcript’s imaging result ('X-rays are three views of the finger are normal'). Benchmark adds 'left index', which was not explicitly stated in the imaging sentence; per instructions, not penalized. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Lists the same active problems as the benchmark (trigger finger and left index finger pain) with equivalent wording. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 1 | Major discrepancy: candidate states 'trigger release today' and 'not having the injection,' while the benchmark plan is for a trigger finger injection. The contradiction represents a substantial content error. Note: the benchmark’s follow-up instruction ('Return in 2 weeks') is not in the transcript and is not a basis for penalization. |

**Total Score:** 28

**Percentage:** 80

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note accurately captured the patient name, chief complaint, HPI, imaging, and assessment, closely aligning with the benchmark. The main shortcomings were in the musculoskeletal verbatim section (missing several dictated elements) and a significant plan mismatch (stating trigger release and no injection instead of trigger finger injection). Overall, good factual accuracy with critical errors in the plan and incomplete exam transcription.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Candidate and benchmark both list '-' and no name is provided for this patient in the transcript (the only name mentioned, 'Gianna Saborio,' pertains to a different patient). |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Content matches benchmark ('left small finger locking and catching'); the added 'Evaluation of' does not change meaning and remains concise. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately reflects transcript: onset (~2 years), prior trigger finger surgery delaying care, desire for treatment, right-hand dominant designer, and no other triggers today. It adds a minor inferred statement ('There is no mention of acute trauma or recent change'), which is not explicitly stated. Not penalized for omitting the benchmark’s note about job impact, as that detail is not in the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Captures the same findings as the benchmark: skin 'purging,' no erythema, moderate TTP, palpable nodule, excellent ROM, well-healed middle finger incisions. Candidate preserves the verbatim/garbled phrasing from the transcript; benchmark’s cleaned 'A1 pulley' is not explicitly stated in the transcript, so no penalty for its absence. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Candidate states 'X-rays are normal,' matching the transcript. Benchmark adds finger/side specificity; since that detail isn’t explicitly stated in the imaging sentence, no penalty for its omission. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes the correct diagnosis ('Left small finger trigger finger') aligning with the benchmark. However, it adds extra items: a historical 'status post' surgery (not an active problem) and a negative statement ('No other trigger digits'), which should not be in Assessment. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Conveys the planned trigger release (albeit awkwardly: 'Plan will be planned trigger'). Adds a non-plan statement ('He is not having any other triggers today'). Benchmark includes follow-up ('Return to clinic in 2 weeks'), which is not stated in the first patient’s transcript; not penalized for omission. |

**Total Score:** 31

**Percentage:** 88.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely aligns with the benchmark, accurately capturing chief complaint, HPI essentials, exam findings, and imaging. The main discrepancies are minor: one inferred line in HPI, inclusion of non-active/negative items in the Assessment, and an extra non-plan statement in the Plan. Overall factual content is strong and faithful to the transcript.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Captures 'wrist pain' accurately but adds extra detail about function and surgery interest beyond the concise benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Includes all key transcript facts (improved synovitis after injection, osteoporosis infusion, right TWA interest, bilateral wrist arthritis, knee recovery) with no unsupported additions. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark is '-' (no discrete MSK exam findings). Candidate included a general exam statement and an imaging instruction, which are not specific MSK findings. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Includes 'The imaging you can leave all the same,' but omits the benchmark detail to delete the large, poorly defined nodule. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Correctly lists bilateral wrist arthritis and synovitis, but omits osteoporosis present in the transcript/benchmark and adds 'status post knee replacement.' Not penalized for missing 'skin intact' since it's not in the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Appropriately plans for right wrist arthroplasty and continuation of osteoporosis infusion (aligned with benchmark), but adds an unsupported follow-up statement. Not penalized for missing 'RTC in 2 weeks' since that timing is not in the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note aligns well with the benchmark on core facts (HPI, surgical interest, improved synovitis, osteoporosis infusion). Deviations include an over-detailed chief complaint, inclusion of non-specific exam/imaging text in the musculoskeletal section, omission of osteoporosis in the assessment, and an unsupported follow-up in the plan. Overall, mostly accurate with some formatting and detail discrepancies.

|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | No patient name in transcript; candidate correctly used '-'; matches benchmark. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Candidate: 'No relief from previous injection' vs benchmark: 'Follow up for hand pain.' Transcript does not explicitly state 'hand pain' or that the visit is a follow-up chief complaint, so not penalized heavily; however, content differs from benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate includes exam/objective details (CMC hypopigmentation, first dorsal compartment, finger stain, grind) and adds 'tenderness' not stated. Only 'no relief from prior injection' and seeking evaluation match benchmark; HPI should exclude exam findings. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Essentially matches the dictated exam; minor differences (added filler like 'on exam,' and 'Um') but factual content aligns with benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging mentioned in transcript; candidate correctly returned '-'; matches benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark lists only 'Pain in hand.' Candidate adds unsupported problems ('Swelling', 'Trigger finger', 'Status post injection'); only 'Hand pain' aligns. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Includes the two plan items from benchmark (trial of 'dig verban's' injection; return in 6 weeks) in transcript-consistent wording; adds a non-plan statement about prior injection relief, which is extraneous. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** Strong alignment on patient name, imaging, musculoskeletal exam verbiage, and key plan elements. HPI improperly included exam details and an unstated 'tenderness.' Assessment hallucinated multiple conditions beyond the benchmark. Chief complaint differs from the benchmark but remains transcript-supported.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to the benchmark and explicitly stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Captures left wrist pain but omits 'and masses,' which are included in the benchmark and transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Accurately summarizes all key details from the transcript (night pain, two masses with prior fluctuation, rheumatology visit with X-ray/ultrasound). Additional demographic details are transcript-based and not contradictory. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Candidate provides verbatim exam details from the transcript, whereas the benchmark is '-'. Although factually correct, it does not match the benchmark's content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Fully matches the benchmark findings (thumb MCP osteophyte on X-ray; ultrasound showing bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte at dorsal MCP and a retinacular cyst at the first dorsal compartment). Only tense/wording differs slightly. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Includes two correct problems (left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst; left thumb MCP osteophyte) but adds 'bilateral osteophytes' which is not supported by the benchmark or clear in the transcript, and omits 'bilateral hand pain' present in the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Includes night splints, aspiration/biopsy consideration, and 6-week follow-up, but omits 'Recommend observation for now for the masses' present in the benchmark; adds 'Review clinical scenario and images' which is not part of the benchmark plan. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** Strong performance on patient identification, HPI, and imaging, with accurate transcript-based content. The chief complaint is incomplete, the musculoskeletal field contains accurate transcript content but diverges from the benchmark’s '-', the assessment includes an unsupported diagnosis and misses an item, and the plan omits the observation recommendation while adding a non-essential step.

| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Mostly aligns with benchmark and transcript, but incorrectly specifies 'bilateral thumb and MCP joint osteophytes' instead of the benchmark's non-specific 'issues/masses'. Otherwise, details about pain severity, nocturnal symptoms, prior evaluations, and imaging are accurate. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark contains '-', while candidate includes exam verbatim. Despite being transcript-accurate, it does not match the benchmark output. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Content matches benchmark: osteophyte on thumb MCP x-ray; ultrasound with bony avulsion fragment vs osteophyte at dorsal thumb MCP; wrist ultrasound showing retinacular cyst superficial to first dorsal compartment sheath. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes key problems but labels 'bilateral thumb and MCP joint' as osteophytes rather than 'masses' per benchmark. Not penalized for omitting normal/negative items in benchmark that are not supported by the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Accurately includes observation, aspiration vs biopsy, and 6-week follow-up. Omits 'recommend night splints' present in benchmark; minor wording ('consider') otherwise acceptable. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.28571428571429

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark in patient name, chief complaint, and imaging. HPI has a minor diagnostic specificity error regarding bilateral thumb/MCP findings. The assessment mirrors this issue. The plan is mostly correct but misses 'night splints.' The MSK verbatim content, while accurate to the transcript, does not match the benchmark’s '-' entry.

| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Candidate captures all plan items stated in the transcript: injection only for trigger finger, home exercise program, and low threshold for formal therapy if no improvement. The benchmark adds 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks,' which is not in the transcript; not penalized per instructions. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly captured the chief complaint, absence of imaging and MSK findings, and the plan elements present in the transcript.

| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Captures most plan elements (continue splint, review X-rays, 10-day follow-up with likely pin removal or repeat X-rays/transition), but omits the explicit referral to Eliza Cherian present in both transcript and benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the chief complaint and imaging accurately and closely reflects the musculoskeletal exam. However, the HPI includes prohibited and inferred details, the assessment diverges from the benchmark with unsupported items, and the plan misses the referral component. Formatting differences are minor, but content accuracy varies across sections.

**Total Score:** 30

**Percentage:** 85.71428571428571

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark on most fields, with accurate chief complaint, imaging, and plan. The main issue is the HPI including objective exam details that should be excluded, and the assessment lacks laterality and exact phrasing. Musculoskeletal exam is essentially verbatim with minor wording differences. Overall, factual alignment is strong with some instruction adherence issues in the HPI and minor detail differences in the assessment.

| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Candidate HPI accurately summarizes the transcript: thumb doing well while using cycloprox and asking whether to continue; prior injection to middle finger with excellent but temporary relief; recurrence of locking/catching with significant pain and seeking further management. Minor wording differences from benchmark (e.g., 'thumb pain') are due to benchmark content not stated in the transcript, so no penalty. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark uses the doctor’s verbatim line: 'Right upper extremity skin is cleaned and intact without erythemohymosis.' The candidate instead provides a different, garbled passage (not the cited doctor phrasing) and includes nail findings, resulting in major content mismatch. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly report '-' as no imaging is mentioned. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Candidate includes middle finger triggering and the prior injection with temporary relief (supported by transcript). It differs from the benchmark by stating 'Thumb pain resolved,' introducing 'pain' not stated in the transcript and omits 'skin intact' from the benchmark. Given benchmark items not supported by transcript are not penalized, minor discrepancies remain. |

| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes correct elements (doing well, minimal pain, lots of ecchymosis) but adds non-HPI details (exam/plan), misattributes '1 cm from palm' to incision, and includes follow-up—deviating from transcript-only HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Contains the key verbatim exam phrases ('incision with varied sutures,' 'moderate ecchymosis') but appends unrelated/plan text and extra filler, unlike the concise benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging mentioned in transcript; both notes correctly return '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Benchmark lists normal findings not present in the transcript (not penalized). Candidate adds 'post-operative ecchymosis' (supported by transcript) but also includes a stray '-' and 'status post carpal tunnel release' which is inferred. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Accurately captures 'return to clinic in 4 weeks'. The second item ('post-operative care for carpal tunnel release') is a looser paraphrase of 'planned post-op endocarpal tunnel' rather than an exact match. |

**Total Score:** 22

**Percentage:** 62.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures some key facts (HPI symptoms, no imaging, follow-up timing) but deviates from the benchmark by inferring a chief complaint, mixing exam/plan into HPI, overextending the musculoskeletal verbatim section, and providing a non-matching assessment with an extra placeholder item. Overall alignment is moderate with notable inaccuracies and formatting issues.

# REC-6904

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to the transcript (“Jane Pollock”). |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 1 | Benchmark lists 'Follow-up' per transcript; candidate gives a symptom-based complaint, not the stated chief complaint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes correct elements (follow-up, overall well, soreness/stiffness, minimal pain, bruising) but adds exam findings (ecchymosis, finger position, distance from palm, right upper extremity) that belong in the objective exam, not HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Captures a substantial verbatim portion of the doctor's musculoskeletal exam but omits the incisions status included in the benchmark. The included text is accurate; however, content is incomplete. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging mentioned in transcript; both candidate and benchmark correctly use '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 1 | Major mismatch with benchmark content. Candidate lists symptom/exam problems, while benchmark lists normal findings. Note: 'No tenderness to palpation' is not in the transcript and is not penalized for omission, but overall content does not align with the benchmark. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Correctly includes follow-ups in 6 days and 1 week with consideration for suture removal/therapy, but incorrectly states 'Remove soft dressings and drive,' which contradicts the benchmark and misinterprets the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 19

**Percentage:** 54.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly identified the patient and imaging status and partially captured the musculoskeletal exam and follow-up plans. However, it misrepresented the chief complaint, introduced exam details into the HPI, omitted part of the musculoskeletal findings, diverged significantly from the benchmark assessment, and misstated the dressing plan.

# REC-6911

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | Benchmark lists 'Walt' and the transcript explicitly mentions 'Walt'; candidate returned '-', omitting the available patient name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Benchmark: 'Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.' Candidate: 'Numbness after carpal tunnel release,' which shifts focus and adds postop context. While numbness is mentioned in the transcript, this does not match the benchmark’s chief complaint exactly. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Candidate captures minimal pain and concern about numbness, but omits the 'busy day' detail and adds 'underwent carpal tunnel release,' which is not stated in the benchmark HPI. Not penalizing absence of 'police officer' since that expansion of 'PO1' is not clearly stated in the transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Findings match the benchmark content: clean incision, variant sutures, moderate ecchymosis consistent with postoperative state, and good but not full finger motion. Minor fillers do not change factual content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging mentioned in transcript or benchmark; candidate correctly returned '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 0 | Benchmark lists 'Status post carpal tunnel release'; candidate left the assessment as '-', omitting the stated diagnosis. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Captures the benchmark plan (post-op endo carpal tunnel and return in 4 weeks). Minor additions ('release', 'for follow-up') but core content and timing are correct. |

**Total Score:** 21

**Percentage:** 60.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures musculoskeletal findings, lack of imaging, and the plan well. However, it misses the patient name and the assessment from the benchmark, and shows partial deviations in chief complaint and HPI (omitting 'busy day' and adding surgical detail). Overall, moderate alignment with key clinical content but with notable omissions.

# REC-6922

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to transcript: 'Mahika Mahendru' stated by the doctor. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Concise and factually consistent with benchmark: pain distal to the splint. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes exam/plan details (pressure on dorsal aspect, inability to sublux extensor tendons, excellent PAP, and modification consideration) which should not be in HPI; also adds 'right hand' not stated in the transcript. The core history matches but with multiple inappropriate additions. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Captures the doctor's musculoskeletal exam content (splint in place, mild soft tissue, hypersensitivity distal to splint, pressure on dorsal aspect, unable to sublux extensor tendons, excellent PAP). Minor issues include inclusion of the patient's interjection ('right?') and slightly garbled phrasing. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging mentioned in transcript; '-' correctly used, matching the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Includes 'Hypersensitivity distal to the splint' matching the benchmark and adds 'pain distal to splint' and 'splint-related nerve irritation,' both supported by the transcript. Not penalized for omitting benchmark items ('skin intact', 'no TTP') since those are normal findings and not present in the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Plan matches the transcript and benchmark exactly: modify splint; RTC Monday if no improvement; RTC in 3 weeks. |

**Total Score:** 31

**Percentage:** 88.57

**Overall Summary:** Strong overall alignment with the benchmark. Patient name, chief complaint, imaging, assessment, and plan are accurate. The main deficiency is in the HPI, which inappropriately includes exam/plan details and a minor side/structure inference. Musculoskeletal exam is largely correct but includes a minor patient interjection.

# REC-7051

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to benchmark ('Magara') and explicitly stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Matches benchmark content ('Bilateral hand numbness and tingling'); concise and accurate. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Includes all benchmark elements (right-hand dominant retiree, onset ~Jan 2025, no trauma/injection, nocturnal symptoms improved with braces, denies pain/limited motion) with only minor wording differences. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark shows no musculoskeletal verbatim ('-'), whereas the candidate includes a long mixed passage that also incorporates imaging details; major mismatch with the benchmark field content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Conveys the same findings as the benchmark (right hand IP narrowing with notable thumb MCP involvement; left hand variable narrowing with severe CMC narrowing). Minor wording differences only. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate adds and modifies items compared to benchmark: includes symptom ('bilateral hand numbness and tingling') and imaging finding ('joint space narrowing'), downgrades 'carpal tunnel syndrome' to 'possible,' and omits benchmark items ('Skin is intact', 'No tenderness to palpation'). Multiple differences from ground truth. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Includes nerve studies and return to clinic, consistent with benchmark, but specifies '6–8 weeks' vs benchmark '6 weeks.' Otherwise faithful to transcript. |

**Total Score:** 27

**Percentage:** 77.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark for patient name, chief complaint, HPI, and imaging, and largely aligns with the plan aside from follow-up interval wording. However, it diverges in the assessment by adding/modifying items and misses the benchmark’s inclusion of certain exam findings. The musculoskeletal verbatim field notably does not match the benchmark and mixes exam with imaging content.

# REC-7060

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly return '-' as no patient name is provided in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Candidate states 'Right ring finger trigger finger recurrence' vs. benchmark 'Trigger finger.' Content aligns with the main issue; candidate adds side and recurrence, which are accurate but more detailed than the benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Core narrative (follow-up, managing thumb CMC arthritis, recurrence of right ring finger trigger finger) aligns with the benchmark. However, the candidate adds exam findings (tenderness) and an overly specific date ('February 25, 2020') not reflected in the benchmark, and omits that she is asking about next steps. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark has '-', while the candidate includes verbatim MSK exam details from the transcript. Although the candidate content reflects the transcript, it does not match the benchmark's content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly indicate no imaging results ('-'). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Both problems are represented (CMC arthritis and right ring finger trigger finger). However, the candidate omits 'right thumb' specificity for CMC arthritis and adds 'status post injections,' which is not in the benchmark and is not clearly supported for the CMC arthritis. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Candidate includes conservative management and surgical release after three injections, which aligns with the benchmark. However, it incorrectly adds 'Proceed with carpal tunnel release' (benchmark indicates continuing night splinting) and does not include discussing risks; also uses 'night lifting' rather than 'night splinting' per the benchmark. Do not penalize for the benchmark-only follow-up timing. |

**Total Score:** 23

**Percentage:** 65.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the main problems and basic plan elements but diverges from the benchmark with added exam details in the HPI, less precise assessment wording, and significant plan inaccuracies (incorrectly stating carpal tunnel release and omitting risk discussion). Chief complaint and non-imaging fields are generally aligned, and imaging is correctly left as '-'.

# REC-7062

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Patient name is not mentioned in the transcript; both benchmark and candidate correctly use '-'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Candidate states 'continued soft tissue swelling with hand activity,' which preserves the meaning of the benchmark 'Soft tissue swelling' with minor extra wording. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | While the candidate captures swelling with activity and the hypersensitivity/improving sensation timeline, it improperly includes objective exam findings and adds 'postoperative,' which are not HPI elements and not stated explicitly. It also omits the patient's inquiry about normalcy. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | The candidate reproduces the dictated musculoskeletal exam essentially verbatim with only negligible punctuation/filler differences; factual content matches the benchmark. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging mentioned in transcript; both candidate and benchmark correctly return '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Overlap on soft tissue swelling and improving sensation, but the candidate adds 'well-healed incision' (a normal finding) and 'slight extension lag' not listed in the benchmark. Not penalized for missing benchmark items that were not in the transcript (e.g., skin intact, no TTP). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Plan matches benchmark content (wean splint, advance activity/ROM, RTC in 3 months); ordering and minor phrasing differences are acceptable. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.86

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note aligns well with the benchmark for patient name, imaging, musculoskeletal exam, and plan, and provides a close chief complaint. The main deficiencies are in the HPI, where objective exam elements and an unstated 'postoperative' status were included, and in the assessment, which added non-benchmark items and a normal finding. Overall, clinically accurate but with notable sectioning/placement issues in HPI and assessment.

# REC-7067

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | Patient name ('Lindsay Demash') is explicitly stated in the transcript, but the candidate returned '-'. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Conveys the same complaint as the benchmark with equivalent meaning; only minor wording differences. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 5 | Accurate, coherent summary aligned with the transcript without adding unsupported details. Although the benchmark includes 'right' and 'clicks', these are not clearly available in the transcript and should not be penalized. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Only a partial verbatim extraction; omits multiple dictated elements (e.g., 'Right upper extremity is clean', dorsal finding, osteophyte mention, incision healing, ROM specifics). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | No imaging results mentioned in the transcript; candidate correctly returned '-'. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Deviates from benchmark by adding items (osteophyte, wrist/shoulder aches, status post incision) and omitting 'Arthritis' and other listed problems. Includes the mass but misses other benchmark items. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches the benchmark plan: continue home exercise program, advance activity, and return in 6 months. |

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate captured the chief complaint, HPI, and plan accurately and succinctly. Major issues include missing the explicitly stated patient name, an incomplete musculoskeletal verbatim extraction with several omissions, and an assessment that diverges from the benchmark by adding non-listed items and omitting 'Arthritis'.

| HPI_SPENCER | 4 | Accurately summarizes the course: Oct 2023 left distal radius fracture from a fall, surgery with Dr. Rice, CRPS diagnosis, persistent stiffness limiting push-ups, able to do Pilates with modifications. Minor variance on timing of CRPS ('post-operatively' vs 'at time of injury') and inclusion of social detail; overall meaning preserved. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 4 | Nearly verbatim to benchmark; differs by 'while healing' vs 'well healing'. Otherwise matches phrasing and measurements. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Captures key findings (well-healed fracture, hardware, good plate alignment, adequate reduction). Omits 'left wrist,' 'post-op,' and 'stable' wording present in benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 4 | Includes CRPS and status post distal radius fracture (worded slightly differently) and adds persistent wrist stiffness, which is a relevant active problem. Content aligns with benchmark without contradictions. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Contains core elements from the benchmark (advance activity/return to Pilates, 3-month follow-up) and adds counseling about push-up limitation and reviewing X-rays, both stated in the transcript. Minor phrasing differences. |

**Total Score:** 29

**Percentage:** 82.85714285714286

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely aligns with the benchmark across all fields, with only minor wording differences and some additional but accurate details from the transcript. No major inaccuracies or omissions were noted.

# REC-7079

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Exact match to the transcript: 'Bertha Campos' is explicitly stated. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Candidate states 'Follow-up for post-operative care' which is less specific than the benchmark's 'Follow up for sutures removal'; main intent preserved but key detail (suture removal) omitted. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes exam/assessment details ('incision is clean and intact', 'no evidence of complications') and implies post-removal status within HPI. Benchmark limits HPI to follow-up for suture removal and improving motion without objective findings. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 3 | Partially verbatim and accurate (ROM without pain, full extension, no triggering, postoperative ecchymosis) but omits earlier dictated lines present in the benchmark ('incision clean intact...', 'sutures removed today', 'patient...without complication') and slightly alters phrasing (e.g., omits 'excellent'). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly indicate no imaging information ('-'). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Candidate lists no active problems ('-'), which is reasonable given the transcript lacks explicit active diagnoses. The benchmark includes normal findings not present in the transcript; per instructions, not penalized for benchmark-only content. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 3 | Correctly includes 'Sutures removed today.' Adds 'Follow-up as needed,' which is not in the transcript (hallucination). Not penalizing for omission of 'Return to clinic in 2 weeks' since that timing appears in the benchmark but not in the transcript. |

**Total Score:** 26

**Percentage:** 74.29

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the patient name and lack of imaging correctly and partially aligns on the musculoskeletal findings and general visit context. Key shortcomings include an imprecise chief complaint, HPI contamination with objective findings and post-removal status, and a hallucinated follow-up instruction in the plan. Differences where the benchmark includes details not in the transcript were not penalized.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Matches benchmark '-' and transcript contains no explicit patient name. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'Left index finger injury'. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 2 | Includes core facts (mechanism, timing around 8/15/25, pain with motion, no deformity/angulation, ED visit with fracture, lacerations), but has multiple inaccuracies and additions: wrong hand dominance (left vs transcript right), misinterpreted date/time ('8:15 AM on the 25th'), wrong joint (PIP vs MCP), adds 'minimally displaced' not stated for the index finger, and introduces non-HPI details ('age 22', counseling and plan). |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark is '-', but candidate includes content and mixes in non-exam info ('he went to the emergency room...'). This does not match the ground truth and is not limited to verbatim MSK findings. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Captures that X-rays showed a fracture, but omits the additional benchmark detail that a previous hand X-ray demonstrated a minimally displaced fracture in the small finger. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Includes 'fracture' and 'lacerations' consistent with benchmark, but omits 'Skin is intact' and adds an extra item ('limited flexion/extension of middle finger at PIP') not in benchmark and with incorrect joint compared to transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Closely aligns with benchmark plan: fracture cast, protect lacerations with soft dressing under splint, Burning Man risk counseling (sand/sweat), antibiotics for a few days, and follow-up on return. The benchmark's 'return in 2 weeks' detail is not in the transcript; no penalty applied. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note correctly captured the chief complaint and plan, and partially matched imaging and assessment. However, the HPI contained several factual inaccuracies (hand dominance, date/time, joint specificity, and an unwarranted 'minimally displaced' qualifier) and included plan details. The musculoskeletal verbatim section did not match the benchmark and mixed in non-exam content. Overall accuracy is moderate with notable errors in HPI and MSK sections.

| PATIENT_NAME | 5 | Both candidate and benchmark correctly use '-' as no patient name is stated in the transcript. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 4 | Benchmark: 'Follow-up'. Candidate includes 'Follow-up' but adds extra detail (middle finger sensitivity, nail fold separation). Meaning is preserved but less concise than benchmark. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | Benchmark includes only subjective improvement and middle-finger sensitivity. Candidate adds exam findings (nail fold separation, ecchymosis, joint stiffness), plan details, and 'post-traumatic arthritis/denies fracture,' which are not in the benchmark HPI. Major content mismatch. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Benchmark is '-' (no verbatim MSK text). Candidate provides a verbatim string, so it does not match the ground truth. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 5 | Exact match to benchmark: 'X-rays deferred.' |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Candidate includes some matching problems (ring finger nail fold separation, middle finger ecchymosis, stiff DIP). However, it adds items not in benchmark (middle finger sensitivity, post-traumatic arthritis) and omits 'Excellent PIP motion' from benchmark. Not penalized for benchmark items not in transcript (e.g., skin intact, no TTP). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Matches two benchmark items (RTC in 1 week with repeat X-rays; transition to removable splints). Adds extra elements (relative motion protection, RTC 6–8 weeks) likely from a second patient and omits 'Continue current treatment' phrasing from the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 20

**Percentage:** 57.14

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note partially aligns with the benchmark on core elements (patient name, imaging, parts of the plan). However, it includes inappropriate objective findings and plan details in the HPI, adds extraneous items to the Assessment and Plan (some likely from a second patient), and deviates from the concise chief complaint. Overall, there are several content mismatches with the benchmark despite some correct elements.

# REC-7241

| Title | Score | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| PATIENT_NAME | 1 | Benchmark uses '-' due to no single clear patient name; candidate entered 'James' (first name only) and likely referenced a different patient segment. Not a full exact name and deviates from the ground truth choice to leave it unknown. |
| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 5 | Semantically matches the benchmark: recurrence on the right and new triggering on the left, concise and accurate. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 3 | Core elements match (follow-up for right recurrence and new left triggering, inquiry about injections, defer right, no prior left injection). However, candidate adds exam details (swelling, nodule) and infers ongoing post-op protocol, diverging from benchmark’s history-only content. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 5 | Captures the dictated exam findings verbatim (moderate soft tissue swelling, middle finger triggering, nodule). |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Content matches ('X-ray ... some fracture healing') with only minor tense difference from the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 5 | Includes right and left trigger finger and status post surgery (more specific as surgical pinning), aligning with benchmark problems. Omission of normal findings from benchmark is not penalized, as those were not in the transcript. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 5 | Matches benchmark plan elements: defer right injection, inject left middle finger today, continue post-op protocol, and follow up with Doctor Hertz. The benchmark’s 'return in 4 weeks' (not in transcript) is reasonably omitted and not penalized. |

**Total Score:** 28

**Percentage:** 80.0

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note closely matches the benchmark on chief complaint, musculoskeletal verbatim, assessment, and plan. Imaging is essentially correct with minor wording differences. The main deficiencies are in the HPI (inclusion of exam/plan elements and extra details) and patient name (incorrectly populated and incomplete). Overall, solid clinical content alignment with some adherence issues to field-specific instructions.

| CHIEF_COMPLAINT | 3 | Captured the new problem of right index/middle finger triggering, but omitted the concurrent follow-up complaint present in the benchmark and transcript. |
| HPI_SPENCER | 1 | Contains major discrepancies: frames a single patient with left UE fracture and trigger fingers, adds unsupported negatives (no prior treatment, no mechanism), and omits other HPI elements (neck unchanged, cast discomfort) present in the benchmark and transcript. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 1 | Candidate includes a long, non-verbatim mix (exam, imaging, plan, names) rather than a strict musculoskeletal finding; benchmark shows no dedicated MS quote for this note. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 4 | Accurately reflects both wrist X-ray findings with minor wording differences ('stay in line' vs 'show'); core content matches the benchmark. |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 2 | Includes trigger finger but adds 'status post left UE fracture with healing callus' not listed in benchmark, and omits items like 'skin intact'. Note: 'No tenderness to palpation' in benchmark is not clearly stated in the transcript, so absence of that item is not penalized. |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 4 | Contains all key plan elements (transition to short arm cast left, wean right, injection for trigger finger, RTC with repeats, consider removable splint). Minor deviations: missing 'cast' after 'wean' and unspecified weeks. The benchmark specifies '6 weeks', which is not clearly stated in the transcript, so this is not penalized. |

**Total Score:** 16

**Percentage:** 45.71

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note partially aligns with imaging and plan, but it misses the explicitly stated patient name, provides an HPI with unsupported and omitted details, and the musculoskeletal section is not verbatim and includes non-exam content. Assessment partially overlaps but includes an extra condition not in the benchmark. Imaging is close to perfect; plan is largely correct with minor wording gaps.

**Total Score:** 25

**Percentage:** 71.43

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note aligns on patient name and plan, and mostly matches the chief complaint and musculoskeletal section with minor phrasing differences. The HPI includes inappropriate exam details and an incorrect finger specification relative to the benchmark. Imaging omits the MRI need, and the assessment diverges notably from the benchmark.

Minor issue: adds paresthesia, which is an exam finding in the transcript, not HPI. |
| MUSCULOSKELETAL_VERBATIM | 2 | Benchmark left this field as '-', while the candidate included verbatim exam text from the transcript. Although accurate to the transcript, it does not match the benchmark content. |
| IMAGING_RESULTS | 3 | Candidate includes today's x-ray finding (distal phalanx fracture with stable alignment and good healing) but omits prior imaging results noted in the benchmark (urgent care x-ray showing fracture and 4-week repeat showing continued fracture). |
| ASSESSMENT_SPENCER | 3 | Partial overlap: includes distal phalanx fracture, DIP stiffness, and paresthesia. Missing several benchmark items (e.g., hematoma, crush injury, healing/alignment detail). |
| PLAN_SPENCER_ | 2 | Includes 'avoid hanging from hands' and correct follow-up ('return in 3 weeks'). However, it incorrectly adds 'continue splinting' (not in transcript) and omits 'advanced activity' directed in the benchmark. |

**Total Score:** 24

**Percentage:** 68.57

**Overall Summary:** The candidate note captures the chief complaint and much of the HPI accurately, and includes correct imaging and plan elements, but it diverges from the benchmark by adding an exam item into the HPI, providing musculoskeletal verbatim text where the benchmark is empty, omitting earlier imaging details, limiting the assessment items, and misstating the plan by adding 'continue splinting' and omitting 'advanced activity.'
