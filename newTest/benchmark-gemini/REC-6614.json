She reports the pain is more bothersome than the masses, waking her up at night. She seeks treatment options.  She was previously treated by Dr. Ishimori for left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, left thumb MCP osteophyte, and bilateral thumb and MCP joint issues.  The masses used to fluctuate in size but are now constant.  She consulted a rheumatologist who performed x-rays and an ultrasound of the anterior wrist."
