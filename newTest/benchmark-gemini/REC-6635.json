He presents for evaluation of his left index finger pain and stiffness that began after he lacerated his finger on 7-16-25 while working with a chisel. He stated he hit a hard piece of wood, and it slipped and cut his finger.  He went to urgent care, where the wound was irrigated and repaired. The sutures were removed about 14 days later, and when they took the stitches out, the wound opened up. Now he is here for evaluation of a stiff finger."
