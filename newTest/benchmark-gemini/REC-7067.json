She is concerned because it is in a different location than the bumps she gets from her arthritis. It does not limit her, but she wants to make sure everything is okay. She states she is doing well and really turned a corner in May. She feels like she has been making progress since then in her health as well as her wrist. She is able to do more and more with her wrist without pain and has been able to lift some weights. She still gets some clicks and aches and pains in her wrist and shoulder, but it works better."
