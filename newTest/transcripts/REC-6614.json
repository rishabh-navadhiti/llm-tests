Uh, pain is more bothersome than the masses. Uh, it wakes her up at night. She wants to know what she can do about it. Hold on one second. Uh, treated by Dr. Ishimori, I-S-H-I-M-O-R-I. Um, her diagnoses are left first dorsal compartment wrist cyst, um, left thumb MCP- Mm-hmm. ... uh, osteophyte and bilateral ... thumb and mCP joint. They both used to get bigger and smaller, but now have been pretty constant overall. Um, she saw her rheumatologist who took x-rays and an ultrasound of the front of the wrist. Um, she's here for evaluation and treatment. On exam, left upper extremity skin is clean during check without anthraea maracunasis. There is a pea-sized mass over the first dorsal compartment. No tenderness or location over the mass. It is mobile and non-tender. Negative Finklestein, no pain with resisted thumb extension. Um, there is a mass at the dorsal ulnar aspect of the thumb MCP joint that is non-mobile and very minimally tender, excellent range of motion at the thumb MCP. No tenderness or location at the A1 point, no locking or catching. Um, images, uh, outside x-rays are viewed with an osteophyte noted at the thumb MCP joint. Um... Uh, ultrasound demonstrates a bony avulsion fragment versus osteophyte at the dorsal aspect of the MCP joint of the thumb. And then ultrasound of the wrist demonstrates a retinacular cyst, uh, superficial to the, um, first dorsal compartment sheath. Uh, plan, we plan carpal tunnel, recommend night splints. Uh-",
