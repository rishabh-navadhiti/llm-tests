      "Mr. Hutchinson is a follow-up patient who reports that he is doing much better since his last visit, with no side effects from steroid therapy. However, his symptoms remain unresolved. He continues to experience pain and swelling localized to the medial border of the PAP joint. Although joint motion has improved, it remains abnormal. The area of swelling and redness has become isolated to this specific region. The patient is seeking clarification regarding the underlying cause of his persistent symptoms. Imaging studies were performed: an x-ray was deferred, and an ultrasound revealed a hyperechoic lesion at the PAP joint, consistent with either calcification or crystals. Further evaluation with MRI is recommended to better characterize the lesion and guide diagnosis."
