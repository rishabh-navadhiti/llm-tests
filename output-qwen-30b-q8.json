      "Mr. Hutchinson is a follow-up patient who reports that he is doing much better since his last visit, with no side effects from the steroid treatment. However, his symptoms of pain and swelling persist. The area of swelling and redness has localized to the medial border of the PAP joint. He notes that joint motion has improved but remains abnormal. He is seeking clarification on the underlying cause of his ongoing symptoms. Diagnostic imaging includes an ultrasound that revealed a hyperechoic lesion at the PAP joint, consistent with either calcification or crystals. The plan includes deferring plain radiography and recommending an MRI for further evaluation to determine the nature of the lesion and guide management."

The differential diagnosis includes crystal-induced arthropathy, osteoarthritis with secondary calcification, or a localized soft tissue calcification. No definitive diagnosis has been established. The lack of resolution despite prior treatment warrants further investigation.\n\nPlan: An MRI is recommended to further characterize the lesion at the PAP joint, assess surrounding soft tissues, and differentiate between calcific deposits, crystal deposition, or other structural abnormalities. Plain radiography has been deferred based on the ultrasound findings and the need for higher-resolution imaging. No new medications or interventions are initiated at this time.
