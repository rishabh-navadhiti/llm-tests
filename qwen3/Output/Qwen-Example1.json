He reports that his symptoms have not resolved despite prior treatment with steroids, which were well-tolerated without side effects. He notes improvement in joint motion, though it remains suboptimal and not within normal range. The area of swelling and redness has become more localized to the medial aspect of the PAP joint. He is seeking clarification on the underlying cause of his ongoing symptoms. Imaging studies include a deferred X-ray and an ultrasound that revealed a hyperechoic lesion at the PAP joint, consistent with either calcification or crystals. An MRI is recommended for further evaluation to determine the etiology of the lesion and guide management."
