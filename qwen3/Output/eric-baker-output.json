      "Curtis Carton, a right-hand dominant marketing professional, sustained a fall while playing basketball on July 22, 2025. He experienced immediate onset of right upper extremity pain, swelling, and limited motion at the time of injury. He left the game and sought care at urgent care the following day. Imaging at that time revealed an intra-articular distal radius fracture with involvement of the radial styloid. He denies any other trauma but continues to experience persistent pain and functional limitation. On current examination, there is ecchymosis on the volar aspect of the right wrist, with limited range of motion at the wrist and pronation secondary to pain. No neurovascular deficits were noted. Radiographic review confirms an intra-articular distal radius fracture, which is potentially unstable. The patient remains symptomatic and is seeking further evaluation and treatment for ongoing pain and functional impairment."
