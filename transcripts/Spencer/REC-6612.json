She continues to have the same sort of achiness in her wrist and limited motion, but this is stable and does not really limit her. She does get some electric sensation to the ulnar and dorsal aspects of her hand, uh, when she is using her hands a lot. She wants to know what this is and if the nerve studies showed anything. Her exam is unchanged. Um, plan is... Oh, if you can pull the nerve study results in, that'd be great. Plan would be, um, regarding the wrist, uh, she is doing well. She continuing to gain strength. Recommend advanced activity, has tolerated advanced laboring. And then you can delete the carpal tunnel. Regarding the cervical radiculopathy, review the nerve studies. Um, there is no evidence of carpal tunnel. There is perhaps some evidence of, uh, ulnar nerve compression of Guyon's canal, but she is not symptomatic in that distribution. We will watch this for now. Recommend urology consult for evaluation of radiculopathy. Uh, return to clinic in six weeks for follow-up. Disability, um, okay for full duty starting 9-1-2025.",
