        "conversation": "... about her fingers. She was having, uh, increasing pain and deformity diffusely to her DIP joints. Her, um, manicurist says that arthritis is getting worse. She wants to know what's going on. She's having a lot of pain at the, uh, trapeziometic carpal joints. On exam, bilateral upper extremities, there is a diffuse angulation and deformity at the DIP joints, moderate tenderness and dislocation diffusely to them. Um, she is unable to flex at the right small finger DIP secondary to the arthritis, but there is some remained flexion and extension of the remaining DIP joints. Um... Moderate tenderness and dislocation at the trapeziometic carpal joint, mild shoulder sign, no tendon desquamation at the A1 pulleys. X-rays are three views, the right-hand view and the left-hand demonstrate a variable joint space narrowing at the DIP joints diffusely as compared to the 2002 images. This is progressed at all digits except the left small finger DIP, which is fused with stable hardware. There is moderate joint space narrowing at the trapeziometic carpal joint. Um, there'll be plan arthritis regarding the bilateral thumb CMC arthritis. This is what is causing the most pain. Uh, recommend trial of steroid injections. Talked about rebound pain, talked about, um, temporary relief. And then regarding the DIP arthritis, we discussed that there's nothing she can do to prevent worsening of the arthritis in terms of X-ray findings, but there are things that we can do, um, to make it hurt less. That's why she's wearing the splints. Um, she doesn't necessarily need them. It is just for pain. Recommend activity is hard. Consider DIP fusion whenever she would like. Uh, and then Kathy Smith is here today for follow-up. She states that she's doing okay overall. She still has some swelling and pain. Hold on one second. She said so she's doing okay. She has not been very thrilled with her, um... She's not been particularly thrilled with her hand therapy and she wants to know if she can maybe come back to Jack. Uh, on exam, incisions will heal. Min- minimal scar, some continued tenderness to palpation at the A1 pony incision. No tendon salvation at the dorsal hand. This is where there is some, uh, scarred appearance there. Um, full fist moderate soft tissue swelling, uh, in the left space especially. Excellent range of motion overall. Some continued pain with motion. Uh, plan will be continue therapy. Okay- I, I feel like I had surgery... ... to transition care for- So I put- ... with Jack. Return to clinic in six weeks for follow-up. Right. Um, did I do Jedediah Bowles already? Yeah, she's... Okay. So then we have Brigitte Metman who is a right-hand dominant female- Mm-hmm. ... without previous injury. She has a peripheral neuropathy in carpal tunnel. Uh... Um... Over the last month or so, she has been having a lot of burning from her mid-palm to her mid-forearm. This is different than her baseline, um, peripheral neuropathy. She thought it may be related to something, um, in her neck. Dr. Gordon referred her to this office. On exam, right upper extremity, skin is clean, dry, intact. There is some erythema...... and edema at the wrist. There is no specific tenderness to palpation, got NCTS though unable to flex enough for a Phalen's. Um... Plan will, or x-rays are normal. Previews of the right wrist plan will be, um, regarding the right wrist. Uh, reviewed the x-rays and clinical scenario, this is a muddied picture in the setting of her peripheral neuropathy. Uh, recommend nerve studies, recommend neurology consult, recommend night splints. Uh, return to clinic after nerve studies. And then, uh, Samar Actrion is a right hand dominant accountant. Uh, she has bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. She presents today for evaluation of her bilateral hand pain that has been progressively worsening for about four years and it's the worst it has ever been, uh, over the last three weeks. Um... She states that she has seen many doctors and had many x-rays and no one can figure out exactly what's going on. She had nerve studies years ago at Kaiser that were reportedly normal. Uh, she wants to know what's going on. On exam, bilateral abrasion of the skin is clean, dry and intact without erythema or ecchymosis. Um... Mild tenderness to palpation diffusely through the hand. Excellent range of motion except for the left thumb is stiff at the, uh, MCP joint. No tenderness or palpation of the left thumb A1 fully. Um, got PCTS. Um... I did not do Sims 1 this morning. Um, x-rays... Deferred. Uh, plan will be plantar carpal tunnel. Recommend repeat nerve studies as I do not have a record that her symptoms have progressed. Recommend night splints. Return to clinic after nerve studies.",
