    "conversation": "Okay. Um... I saw Milo Gomez, who is here today with his mom and sister for follow-up. He says that his finger hurts. Mom says he is not avoiding any of his activities. Um, she has some questions about his nail growth. On exam, he willingly gives high fives, he makes a full fist, he grabs his chair handles and plays with toys without any avoidance of the middle finger. Um, new nail ingrowing about 70% of the way with excellent constancy since the proximal 30%. Um, full active motion ad lib at this time. Plan... Uh, exit deferred plan will be a- advance activities tolerated, advance range of motions tolerated. Return to clinic in six to eight weeks for follow-up.",
